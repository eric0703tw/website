[Context: Notes: 需翻譯_去時間軸/How I Changed My Life in 1 Year with Reverse Goal Setting-en.md]
[Timestamp: 2026/01/03 22:46:45]

**ai**: on May 26th 2019 I left my job as a medical doctor I felt dissatisfied and unhappy with life dreading Sunday evenings knowing that I'd have to wake up the next day for work but just one year later I became the most fulfilled and energized version of myself I'd ever been and I achieved this transformation through a powerful method I call reverse goal setting and now as a learning coach for the past 13 years reverse goal setting is the method that I teach to thousands of students and professionals worldwide to help them plan and build out their dream lives in this video I'm going to explain what the biggest problems with normal or conventional goal setting are and how you can fix those problems with the five steps of reverse goal setting let's get started more often than not normal goal setting can be a complete waste of time that's why most people who set goals don't really achieve them especially for goals that are even slightly more difficult you end up getting stuck in the spiral of setting a goal trying to achieve it failing getting derailed feeling demotivated wondering what's wrong with me why can't I keep achieving these goals it's like this spiral that gets worse and worse with every goal you set but I really think this is because of the way we set our goals not because of who we are so back when I was in my first year of University this is me I had this goal of entering into medical school and so I knew that I wanted to do everything possible to achieve that goal and so I thought what can I do to get into Medical School study more study harder read all the textbooks be a good diligent student and so my plan on a daily basis revolved around how can I make sure I do these activities day in day out and that's what normal ghost Ting kind of looks like you have this overall intention where you want to end up and then you think well what can I do that gets me closer to it and then you think how can I fit that into my schedule how can I be diligent and you use that to Anchor your activities every single day and for a simple enough goal this works fine and actually if I think back to my success of entering into medical school I technically reached my goal but I think really I just got lucky because there were also a lot of other people around me working just as hard doing kind of the same things but they weren't as successful some of them very intelligent very capable people and this is really the problem with noral goal setting is that it focuses on the what to achieve but not the how if you set a goal the path of actually achieving that is very unclear so you have to spend a lot of time trying to figure it out not only is that a waste of time and a waste of energy but sometimes you never even make it to the end because you burnt out you lost your way you ran out of time and I really think that at a certain point in life normal goal setting becomes a waste of time because for most complicated goals you don't know how you're meant to actually achieve it it's the uncertainty that makes it hard in the first place a good example is if I fast forwarded 9 years I've already graduated Medical School I've become a doctor I've been working as a doctor and now ironically I'm trying to create a goal to leave medicine I want to explore entrepreneurship and and education full-time so I've set that as my goal I want to become an entrepreneur and educator full-time so what like what am I actually meant to do you can see how setting the goal doesn't give me any more clarity on how to achieve that and this is where reverse ghting comes in to fix this problem is that it starts with the goal that you want to achieve and it works its way backwards to give you a very clear path of action that you know will inevitably lead to you achieving your goal so now let me show you what the five steps of reverse goal setting are and how you can use that to achieve your goals with more CL CL ity and confidence step one identify your long-term goal you can't plan for an outcome if you don't know what outcome you want on the other hand just because you know what outcome you want doesn't mean you can create a plan to achieve it there's this awesome analogy that I heard from this legendary marketer called Seth Goden he said if you want to hang a painting on on the wall like a really nice painting that you love right into your bedroom and you go to the hardware store to pick up a drill and a drill bit your goal there is not to buy a drill and a drill bit your goal is to have a hole in the wall so that you can put a screw through that to hang your painting on it but your goal is not to have a hole in the wall your goal is to have the painting on the wall but your goal is also not to have the painting on the wall your goal is to have a certain feeling that you think you will have when you see that painting on the wall that's your real goal your goal is the feeling you think that that will give you and I think this applies a lot for the life goals that we set when I was 15 thinking I want to be a doctor that was a goal that I had in mind but it's not that I wanted to be a doctor there were all these other criteria in my mind that I was checking off that I attached to that goal a level of financial stability a level of fulfillment in my life a type of work that I thought I would enjoy and be good at and 10 years later after having achieved that goal what I realized is that it didn't take some of those boxes as much as I would have wanted it didn't provide me as much fulfillment and satisfaction as I I thought it would give me the work was not what I had anticipated it to be and the moral of the story here is not to go back in time slap my 15 15-year-old 16-year-old self and say think harder about your goal it's that when you look so far ahead there are so many levels of uncertainty there's so much you don't know about yourself your life situation about the goal itself that it becomes almost meaningless to Anchor that in as a goal and so as a general principle I think what's in ibly useful for goal setting is don't set goals too far into the future because your plan is almost definitely going to change and you want to stay flexible and adaptable and open to new information and new circumstances you don't want to get locked down into a certain pathway because you said this is the goal I've chosen for myself and even though information keeps coming in saying hey what you really want is this thing and what you thought was a goal is not going to get you there you want to be able to Pivot on that so here's a little activity for you just get a piece of paper out and write down what your long-term Vision or direction is this is like your 5 to 10 year Vision try to keep this one relatively broad underneath that right why what do you think this is going to achieve for you what type of feeling what kind of situation will this help you achieve and make a clear decision mentally that if you realize at some point that this what the goal you've set now is no longer seeming like it's going to tick off the why the reason for setting the goal in the first place give yourself permission to re-evaluate pivot once you've done that break that go down into something that's a little bit more medium-term at most 3 years in advance and you can actually bring this as short as you want like you could do this exact same process for a month of away if your goal is I want to get to the supermarket tomorrow morning you don't need to do this whole process just just just go to the supermarket but if it's further than 3 years your plan starts becoming very risky if one part of the plan breaks it affects everything else for the rest of that plan it's much better to just plan for shorter Sprints and then just constantly re-evaluate that as you go now in Step number four we want to actually specify what is required to achieve this goal like what is the actual requirements that you need to achieve so for example for me it was entering into medical school for me to achieve that there was a certain grade boundary there were these other examinations that I had to have set clearer more specific targets now when you do this activity especially if it's a goal that you're not very certain about there's an important answer that you may arrive at which is incredibly important for you to write down which is you may realize that when you try to specify you don't know you have a goal you want to reach but you don't actually know what the requirements are this is important because it highlights a gap in your planning your immediate Next Step becomes figure that out go learn about it talk to someone get that information so you know and you can actually specify it accurately now up until this point this all falls within the same purview of just normal goal setting this step two is where we really go into reverse goal setting step two is to Define your future self imagine your goal is to have a million dollars and you find a magic lamp and you can rub the lamp and a genie comes out and says hey I will grant you you know your one wish and then you say I wish I could win Lotto and have a million dollars that would not be a great wish in fact actually when you look at a lot of Lotto winners they don't end up continuing to be wealthy a lot of people that win these great sums of money just eventually lose all that money again why is that it's because they have the outcome but they didn't have the skills the habits the perspectives the attributes necessary to keep or grow that wealth and a better wish would be give me the skills and attributes and habits that will let me make a million dollar and this is what we're doing with step number two is that we're looking at the med medium-term goal that you have and you can draw some inspiration from your long-term 5 to 10 year one as well and we're going to create what I call a meta goal and the Met goal is the person for whom it would be easy to achieve this goal if we think about the goal as an outcome and we realize that outcomes cannot be controlled outcomes are symptoms of the process that we control then what becomes important is the process and the person engaging in the process a person who's not capable of engaging in the process who's not capable of even knowing what the right process is is very unlikely to achieve the outcome aka the goal imagine someone who you think is like a complete genius and let's say your goal is to get a a great result in a certain exam this person is great time management never procrastinates focuses amazingly well the memory seems infallible now imagine that they failed this goal how surprised would you be it could happen you know something could happen like who knows but that would be shocking on the flip side think about someone who has terrible time management procrastinates all the time always gets distracted it's never studying the memory is full of holes they've never trained it they study skills all over the place they don't know what they're doing now imagine this person gets the top result in an exam that wild you wouldn't expect that so we can see already intuitively we understand that observing the process someone uses tells us How likely they are to achieve the outcome and this seems obvious but when a goal feels really important we become blind to this fact we start obsessing over the outcome and when we try to engage in the process we're so worried about the outcome that even the time we do spend is not spent effectively because we're so distracted and so while it is normal to worry about a goal that you really care about we need to channel that worry into something more productive which is to evaluate our processes evaluate our skills and think what can we control that will influence the outcome worrying about an outcome doesn't do anything for us and so with this meta goal we're thinking about who is the person that would find achieving this goal easy and then what are the skills and attributes and habits and also opportunities that this person has or has access to that allows this goal to be easy for them and you want to be detailed here you want to be specific think about time management skills task management and prioritization focus and concentration procrastination learn learning ability these are five core areas that I would recommend that you start thinking through to to begin with and by the way if you want to Fast Track Your Improvement in these five areas then you may want to check out my free Weekly Newsletter I basically took my 13 years of coaching experience pulled out what I thought were the most important nuggets of information and I put them into these free weekly newsletters they only take a few minutes to read but aim to save you 10 plus hours a week if you want to join there's a link for you in the description below and now let's get back to the idea of setting our meta goal and so this meta goal becomes our primary number one goal our number one priority is to become that person who would find achieving the goal much easier than who we are right now step three of reverse goal setting is to Define your current self so we know who we need to become so where are we now in relation to that what we do is for each of the skills and attributes and the habits and opportunities that we have identified so far we can rate the requirement for it out of 10 so let's say that if you want to do really well in a certain exam you think that your learning ability needs to be a N9 out of 10 your time management needs to be a a seven out of 10 let's say for example that's your goal so where are you right now right now maybe you are only a three out of 10 10 for both of these things then the Gap you have to fill becomes your plan and when you do step two and step three the same thing as before in step one can happen which is that you may arrive at the answer of I don't know and again this is very important to recognize if you don't even know what the skills and the attributes and the habits and the processes are that will lead to you being successful at your goal that's a problem because now you're relying on luck to get you there if we don't know that becomes the easiest plan of all because again step one becomes how can you know talk to people learn about things do some reading watch some videos understand what the requirements are not of the goal but of the person likewise if you're trying to evaluate your current ability and you don't know that's a problem it means that you don't have that self-awareness and that's nothing to be embarrassed about most people have absolutely no self-awareness until you start directing your attention at it and I can promise you you probably did not have less self-awareness than I did when I first started out so if you're looking at your current learning ability and you're like I actually have no idea what my learn I don't even know how to rank I don't even know how to think about that scoring it out of 10 that's your first step you have to know know where your current ability is and actually during that process of figuring it out it's going to give you a lot of very targeted ways to improve it and as you improve on each of those ways you get closer and closer to becoming the person who can reach the goal and therefore you become closer to your goal the most underrated activity that you can do to begin with is to observe and reflect observe yourself be objective be honest what do you do what type of person do you see yourself as reflect on it and once you know where your current status is you see that gap for what it is I was talking to one of my previous employees the other day uh and she has ADHD she's a very high functioning super intelligent person but has always struggled with just sitting down and getting through a lot of work she's in a in a like a really good position at a new company she's got lots of pressure going on and so she's feeling the struggle like there's so much work she has to do but she struggles with sitting down and really being focused and concentrated and she's talking about all of these different things that she's sort of struggling with and trying to do and she's running into that problem she's setting a goal to try to study this many hours to work this many hours to dedicate that much time and it's failing every single day why is she failing because she's not actually addressing the underlying root cause for it which is her ability to stay focused and to not get distracted and for her I had already told her long ago the things she can do to improve concentration and just to train that ability take it from from a 3 out of 10 to a 5 out of 10 and it had never been a priority for her because it wasn't getting more work done and so you can see the Paradox she's so obsessed about achieving the goal and so motivated to get that work done but doesn't realize that the real Gap is that the person she is right now is not someone who will find it easy to achieve that goal and so the best step is to work on these things that get you closer to the person you need to be and now you don't need all of these other things to help you because it's just easier so once we've defined our current self we move on to step four which is to do a force field analysis a force field analysis is a technique where you take your current self which we've just defined we look at our goal which is our meta goal the future self we want to become uh and on a piece of paper you draw it like this with a this arcing line in between on one side of this are barriers and obstacles what are the things that prevent you from being able to achieve your meta goal on the other side of this line we have drivers what are the things that help us to succeed can push that through these may be our existing skills and habits and attributes and we also write what is our Network and resources to help us achieve this and so we're actually mapping out what are the things that we can employ to overcome these barriers and what are the things we have access to that can help us overcome these barriers to eventually move us along and achieve this goal this is a powerful exercise that I recommend that you do every few months anytime you feel like you're not sure exactly how to keep progressing and this technique is called a force field analysis because we're examining the forces that are keeping you from or pushing you towards your goal so if I use my example who was the person that I needed to be in order to achieve my goal of leaving medicine and going full-time into entrepreneurship and and education I realized that my time management would have to be really really good my prioritization skills would have to be really really good I would have to have access to Opportunities relating to business and certain experiences to make that transition easier and I realized that my current self was lacking in some of those areas my time management skills were pretty good but my prioritization skills weren't so good I had some experiences in business and I've been doing a lot of learning coaching already but I'd never really stepped fully into the role of Entrepreneurship I lacked a lot of those experiences and opportunities that would make that transition easy for me later when I did my force field analysis I realized that I have a lot of people within my network I have access to a lot of these resources that can enable me to do this and so for around 9 to 10 months I started dabbling a little bit more and gaining some of the those experiences in business one of the things that sounds kind of funny for someone that was wanting to do entrepreneurship full-time is that even though I've been running a education and learning coaching business for six and a half years at that point I had never really paid myself from it because most of it was actually done through a nonprofit like I'd set up a charity for education and so I'd never actually paid myself a salary um and so in the last couple of years I started actually just paying myself a salary and then seeing if I could manage the finances of my business when I was paying myself a living wage and so this process what I'm explaining of how I used my insights from this process to create my plan is step five building your plan in this final step we know where we need to get to we have our goal we have our meta goal we know where we currently stand and we know the things that can push and pull us towards that goal now all that's left is to figure out what to start focusing on first as a priority when to start doing it and how if you realize a thing that's lagging behind the most that you think is going to take the longest time for you to fix is your learning skills then that becomes the what to focus on when let's say immediately is the best time to start working on it and then how you figure that out if you don't know how again that becomes an obvious next step learn about how you know you need to work on it you know it's important you know it's a priority just because you don't know how to do it doesn't change the fact that it needs to be worked on sometimes the what when and how is not what you expect I worked with a student a number of years ago who was struggling at University and she had lots of things to work on in her learning skills No Doubt the gap between where she needed to get and her current self was wide and it was going to be a high priority for her to fill that Gap and so we tried to fill that Gap and then after trying for a few weeks I realized that she's not very consistent or diligent I realized that I'm setting her TSS and saying hey this is what you need to do to train your skills and then a week later she'd come back and have practiced almost none of it she was stagnant after digging a little bit deeper and having some more conversations I realized that she's actually being terribly abused at home by her parents that home environment was toxic and so the priorities changed you can't work on learning skills when you don't have that Foundation of stability and safety and so we actually changed the plan completely the number one priority became how can we support her and get her out of the house what was the barrier to that she didn't have a job so we figured out what kind of job can we get her to just make enough money to move out of the house because the time spent working a part-time job yes it takes away from study but in the grand scheme of things it makes so many other things easier that that was going to be the the the bottleneck that we had to solve a month later she moved out got a job moved out found a place to Flat it wasn't the nicest place but that was a life-changing move for her and when she had a little bit more mental space to think about that learning skill stuff again we jumped on that train again couple years later she was thriving she was doing a masters of Health Science and it was a challenging Road for her but she was able to make it through that because of understanding what to focus on when to focus on it how to focus on it and being flexible understanding that the thing you think you may need to do to achieve your goal may not be if you just take a step back and evaluate situation holistically in a less extreme example one thing that I see very very commonly is that people think that they need to improve their learning skills but actually the thing that holds them back the most is actually the fact that they procrastinate all the time or they're not willing to try something new so you can see that is actually a fundamental blocker and in this final step where we're building the plan that will become the what working on our experimentation ability working on our procrastination and this stuff is what enters into your calendar at the end of the day every day there is something that you know is a high priority for you to develop your skills and your attributes and your processes and your habits uh and your access to Opportunities and resources that you know gets you towards your goal and you schedule that into your day into your evenings into your weekends that becomes your plan and as you grow as a person the outcomes you naturally are able to achieve grow with it now there is one thing that I have to mention which is that changing your skills and your habits B is not a quick or easy thing it takes time it takes diligence it probably takes you longer than you expect it to and the more things you try to improve at the same time the harder it gets to improve any of them so when you are plotting your timeline make sure it's a realistic timeline be conservative with how long you think it would take to develop and grow your skills especially if they're habits that you have had for years it's going to take a little bit of time to change that for me transitioning away from medicine during that period of time I would only focus on one maybe two things on any given month and even though I knew there were 10 other things to work on I deliberately stopped myself from working on it to make sure I gave myself the best chance of success and after that roughly a year 10 9 10 months I was able to transition out of medicine relatively smoothly and the thing is all these like all my friends people that I went to UNI with started messaging me saying hey Justin how did you do that like I've also been thinking about quitting being a doctor or quitting being a pharmacist you're so this is what they said is that they said you're so lucky that you had that business to fall back on and if that's what luck is then it seems to be a lot more controllable than you think so this is reverse goal sitting and if you've never set goals like this before then it's very different but if you have struggled with noral goal setting before then you owe it to yourself to at least give this a chance and I will say this I now almost never use normal goal setting for anything anymore if it's important and complicated enough for me to go through and set a goal I use reverse goal setting I hope this helps thanks for watching and I'll see you next time

**ai**: 2019年5月26日，我辭去了醫生的工作。我對生活感到不滿和不快樂，每到星期天晚上就感到恐懼，因為我知道第二天又要上班了。但僅僅一年後，我成為了有史以來最充實、最有活力的自己。我透過一種我稱之為「逆向目標設定」的強大方法實現了這一轉變。現在，作為一名有13年經驗的學習教練，逆向目標設定是我教導全球數千名學生和專業人士的方法，幫助他們規劃和建立夢想生活。在這段影片中，我將解釋傳統目標設定最大的問題是什麼，以及如何透過逆向目標設定的五個步驟來解決這些問題。讓我們開始吧。

通常情況下，傳統目標設定完全是浪費時間。這就是為什麼大多數設定目標的人並沒有真正實現它們，特別是對於那些稍微困難一點的目標。你最終會陷入設定目標、嘗試實現、失敗、偏離軌道、感到沮喪、然後想「我怎麼了？為什麼我無法持續實現這些目標？」的循環中。這就像一個螺旋，你設定的每個目標都會讓情況變得越來越糟。但我真的認為這是因為我們設定目標的方式，而不是因為我們是誰。

所以，當我大學一年級的時候，我設定了進入醫學院的目標。我知道我想盡一切可能實現這個目標。所以我思考，我能做些什麼來進入醫學院？多學習、更努力學習、閱讀所有教科書、成為一個勤奮的學生。所以我的日常計劃圍繞著如何確保我每天都做這些活動。這就是傳統目標設定的樣子：你設定一個總體目標，然後思考「我能做些什麼來接近它？」然後你再思考「我如何將它融入我的日程？我如何保持勤奮？」你用這些來錨定你每天的活動。

對於一個足夠簡單的目標，這很有效。事實上，回想我成功進入醫學院的經歷，我技術上達成了目標，但我認為我只是運氣好，因為我周圍也有很多其他人同樣努力，做著差不多的事情，但他們卻沒有那麼成功，其中一些人非常聰明、非常有能力。這就是傳統目標設定的問題所在：它只關注要「實現什麼」，而不是「如何實現」。如果你設定一個目標，實際實現它的路徑非常不明確，所以你必須花很多時間去摸索。這不僅浪費時間和精力，有時候你甚至無法走到終點，因為你筋疲力盡、迷失方向、時間耗盡。

我真的認為，在人生的某個階段，傳統目標設定會變成浪費時間，因為對於大多數複雜的目標，你不知道該如何實際實現它。正是這種不確定性讓它變得困難。一個很好的例子是，如果我快進9年，我已經從醫學院畢業，成為了一名醫生，並且一直在做醫生。現在諷刺的是，我正試圖設定一個目標來離開醫學界。我想全職探索創業和教育。所以我把這設定為我的目標：我想成為一名全職的企業家和教育家。那麼，我到底該怎麼做呢？你可以看到，設定目標並不能讓我更清楚地知道如何實現它。

這就是逆向目標設定解決這個問題的地方：它從你想要實現的目標開始，然後倒推，給你一個非常清晰的行動路徑，你知道這條路徑將不可避免地引導你實現目標。現在，讓我向你展示逆向目標設定的五個步驟，以及你如何利用它們以更清晰、更自信的方式實現你的目標。

**第一步：確定你的長期目標。**
如果你不知道你想要什麼結果，你就無法為它做計劃。另一方面，即使你知道你想要什麼結果，也不代表你就能制定一個計劃來實現它。我從一位傳奇行銷人員賽斯·高汀那裡聽到一個很棒的比喻。他說，如果你想在牆上掛一幅你非常喜歡的漂亮畫作，掛在你的臥室裡，然後你去五金行買一把電鑽和鑽頭。你的目標不是買電鑽和鑽頭，你的目標是在牆上鑽一個洞，這樣你就可以把螺絲穿過去掛你的畫。但你的目標也不是在牆上鑽一個洞，你的目標是把畫掛在牆上。但你的目標也不是把畫掛在牆上，你的目標是獲得一種你認為當你看到那幅畫掛在牆上時會有的感覺。那才是你真正的目標，你的目標是那種你認為它會帶給你的感覺。

我認為這非常適用於我們設定的人生目標。當我15歲時，我想成為一名醫生，那是我心中的一個目標。但並不是我真的想成為一名醫生，我腦海中還有許多其他標準，我將它們與那個目標聯繫起來：一定程度的財務穩定、一定程度的生活滿足感、一種我認為我會喜歡並擅長的工作。十年後，當我實現了那個目標時，我意識到它並沒有達到我期望的某些標準。它沒有給我帶來我以為會有的那麼多的滿足感和滿意度，工作也不是我預期的那樣。

這個故事的寓意不是要回到過去，打我15、16歲的自己一巴掌，說「更努力地思考你的目標！」而是當你展望未來太遠時，存在太多不確定性。你對自己、你的生活狀況、目標本身都有太多不了解的地方，以至於將其作為目標來錨定幾乎變得毫無意義。

所以，作為一個普遍原則，我認為對於目標設定來說，非常有用的就是不要設定太遙遠的未來目標，因為你的計劃幾乎肯定會改變，你需要保持靈活、適應性強，並對新資訊和新情況保持開放。你不想因為你說「這是我為自己選擇的目標」而鎖定在某條道路上，即使不斷有資訊進來告訴你「嘿，你真正想要的是這件事，而你認為的目標並不能讓你達到那裡」，你也要能夠及時調整。

所以這裡有一個小活動給你：拿出一張紙，寫下你的長期願景或方向。這就像你5到10年的願景，盡量讓它保持相對寬泛。在下面寫下「為什麼？」你認為這會為你實現什麼？會給你帶來什麼樣的感覺？會幫助你實現什麼樣的境況？並在心裡做出一個明確的決定：如果你在某個時候意識到你現在設定的目標不再能實現你設定目標的「為什麼」，也就是最初的原因，那麼請允許自己重新評估和調整。

一旦你完成了這一步，將那個目標分解成一個更中期的目標，最多提前3年。你也可以將這個時間縮短到你想要的程度，比如你可以將這個過程應用到一個月的目標。如果你的目標是明天早上要去超市，你不需要做整個過程，直接去超市就好。但如果目標超過3年，你的計劃就會變得非常冒險，如果計劃中的某一部分出了問題，它會影響整個計劃的其餘部分。最好是規劃更短的衝刺，然後不斷地重新評估。

現在，在第四步中，我們需要實際說明實現這個目標需要什麼，也就是你需要達到什麼實際要求。例如，對我來說，是進入醫學院。為了實現這個目標，有一個特定的成績門檻，還有其他我必須參加的考試。設定更清晰、更具體的目標。

當你進行這項活動時，特別是對於一個你不太確定的目標，你可能會得到一個非常重要的答案，你需要把它寫下來，那就是你可能會意識到當你試圖具體說明時，你不知道。你有一個想要達成的目標，但你實際上不知道需要什麼條件。這很重要，因為它突顯了你計劃中的一個空白。你接下來的直接步驟就是弄清楚這一點：去學習、與人交談、獲取資訊，這樣你就能知道並準確地具體說明它。

到目前為止，這一切都屬於傳統目標設定的範疇。第二步才是我們真正進入逆向目標設定的地方。

**第二步：定義你的未來自我。**
想像你的目標是擁有一百萬美元，你找到一盞神燈，摩擦神燈，精靈出來說：「嘿，我會實現你的一個願望。」然後你說：「我希望中樂透，擁有一百萬美元。」這不會是一個很好的願望。事實上，當你觀察許多樂透中獎者時，他們最終並沒有繼續富有。許多贏得巨額財富的人最終又會失去所有這些錢。為什麼會這樣？因為他們得到了結果，但他們沒有具備維持或增加財富所需的技能、習慣、觀點和特質。一個更好的願望會是：「給我那些能讓我賺到一百萬美元的技能、特質和習慣。」

這就是我們在第二步中所做的：我們審視你擁有的中期目標，你也可以從你的長期5到10年目標中汲取一些靈感，然後我們將創造一個我稱之為「元目標」的東西。元目標是那個能夠輕鬆實現這個目標的人。如果我們將目標視為一個結果，並且我們意識到結果是無法控制的，結果是我們控制的過程的症狀，那麼重要的就是過程以及參與過程的人。一個沒有能力參與過程，甚至不知道正確過程的人，非常不可能實現結果，也就是目標。

想像一個你認為是天才的人，假設你的目標是在某個考試中取得好成績。這個人時間管理能力很強，從不拖延，專注力驚人，記憶力似乎無懈可擊。現在想像他們失敗了這個目標，你會有多驚訝？這可能會發生，誰知道呢，但那會令人震驚。反過來，想像一個時間管理能力很差、總是拖延、總是分心、從不學習、記憶力漏洞百出、從未訓練過、學習技巧一團糟、不知道自己在做什麼的人。現在想像這個人在考試中取得了最高分，那會很瘋狂，你不會預料到。

所以我們已經可以直觀地理解，觀察一個人使用的過程可以告訴我們他們實現結果的可能性有多大。這似乎很明顯，但當一個目標感覺非常重要時，我們就會對這個事實視而不見。我們開始沉迷於結果，當我們試圖參與過程時，我們又如此擔心結果，以至於我們花費的時間都沒有被有效利用，因為我們太分心了。

所以，雖然擔心一個你真正關心的目標是正常的，但我們需要將這種擔心轉化為更具生產力的東西，那就是評估我們的過程，評估我們的技能，並思考我們可以控制什麼來影響結果。擔心結果對我們沒有任何幫助。

所以，有了這個元目標，我們正在思考：誰是那個會覺得實現這個目標很容易的人？然後，這個人擁有或可以獲得哪些技能、特質、習慣以及機會，讓這個目標對他們來說變得容易？你需要在這裡詳細說明，你需要具體。思考時間管理技能、任務管理和優先排序、專注力和集中力、拖延、學習能力。這是我建議你首先開始思考的五個核心領域。順便說一句，如果你想在這些五個領域中快速提升，那麼你可能想看看我的免費每週電子報。我基本上把我13年的教練經驗中最重要的精華提取出來，並將它們放入這些免費的每週電子報中。它們只需要幾分鐘閱讀，但旨在每週為你節省10小時以上。如果你想加入，下方描述中有一個連結。

現在，讓我們回到設定元目標的想法。這個元目標成為我們的首要目標，我們的第一優先事項是成為那個會覺得實現目標比現在的我們容易得多的人。

**逆向目標設定的第三步是定義你的現狀。**
我們知道我們需要成為什麼樣的人，那麼我們現在相對於那個目標處於什麼位置呢？我們所做的是，對於我們目前已經確定的每一項技能、特質、習慣和機會，我們可以給它的要求打分（滿分10分）。所以，假設如果你想在某個考試中取得好成績，你認為你的學習能力需要達到9分（滿分10分），你的時間管理需要達到7分（滿分10分）。假設這就是你的目標。那麼你現在在哪裡呢？現在，也許你這兩項都只有3分（滿分10分）。那麼你需要彌補的差距就成為你的計劃。

當你執行第二步和第三步時，就像第一步一樣，可能會發生這樣的情況：你可能會得到「我不知道」的答案。同樣，這非常重要。如果你甚至不知道哪些技能、特質、習慣和過程會讓你成功實現目標，那就有問題了，因為你現在正依賴運氣來達成目標。如果我們不知道，那就會成為最簡單的計劃，因為第一步又變成了「你怎麼知道？」與人交談、學習、閱讀一些東西、看一些影片，了解需要什麼，不是目標本身，而是那個人的要求。

同樣地，如果你試圖評估你目前的能力，但你不知道，那也是個問題。這意味著你沒有那種自我意識，這沒什麼好尷尬的，大多數人在你開始關注它之前，完全沒有自我意識。我可以向你保證，你剛開始時的自我意識可能不會比我少。所以，如果你正在審視你目前的學習能力，然後你說：「我其實不知道我的學習能力是什麼，我甚至不知道如何評分，我甚至不知道如何思考10分制的分數。」那你的第一步就是：你必須知道你目前的能力在哪裡。事實上，在弄清楚這個過程的過程中，它會給你很多非常有針對性的改進方法。當你在這些方面不斷改進時，你就會越來越接近成為能夠實現目標的人，因此你也會越來越接近你的目標。

最被低估的活動，你可以從一開始就做，就是觀察和反思。觀察自己，保持客觀，誠實地說，你做了什麼？你認為自己是什麼樣的人？反思它。一旦你知道你目前的狀態，你就會看到那個差距是什麼。

我前幾天和一位前員工聊天，她有ADHD，她是一個功能非常強大、超級聰明的人，但她總是難以坐下來完成大量工作。她在一家新公司擔任一個非常好的職位，面臨著很大的壓力，所以她感受到了掙扎，她有很多工作要做，但她很難坐下來真正專注。她談論著她正在掙扎和嘗試做的所有這些不同的事情，她遇到了那個問題。她設定了一個目標，試圖學習這麼多小時，工作這麼多小時，投入那麼多時間，但每天都失敗了。她為什麼失敗？因為她沒有真正解決根本原因，那就是她保持專注和不分心的能力。對她來說，我很久以前就告訴過她可以做些什麼來提高專注力，並訓練這種能力，將它從3分提高到5分。但這對她來說從來都不是優先事項，因為它並沒有讓她完成更多工作。

所以你可以看到這個悖論：她如此執著於實現目標，如此有動力去完成工作，卻沒有意識到真正的差距在於她現在這個人，並不是一個會覺得實現那個目標很容易的人。所以最好的步驟是努力解決這些讓你更接近你所需成為的人的事情，這樣你就不再需要所有這些其他東西來幫助你，因為它會變得更容易。

所以，一旦我們定義了我們的現狀，我們就進入第四步，那就是進行**力場分析**。力場分析是一種技術，你將我們剛剛定義的現狀，與我們的目標，也就是我們想要成為的未來自我，放在一張紙上，像這樣畫一條弧線。這條線的一邊是障礙和阻礙，是什麼阻止你實現你的元目標？這條線的另一邊是驅動力，是什麼幫助我們成功？可以推動我們前進？這可能是我們現有的技能、習慣和特質。我們還會寫下我們的網絡和資源是什麼，可以幫助我們實現這個目標。所以我們實際上是在描繪我們可以利用什麼來克服這些障礙，以及我們擁有什麼資源可以幫助我們克服這些障礙，最終推動我們前進並實現這個目標。

這是一個強大的練習，我建議你每隔幾個月就做一次，每當你覺得不確定該如何繼續前進時。這種技術之所以被稱為力場分析，是因為我們正在檢視那些阻礙你或推動你實現目標的力量。

所以，如果我用我的例子來說，為了實現我離開醫學界並全職投入創業和教育的目標，我需要成為什麼樣的人？我意識到我的時間管理必須非常好，我的優先排序技能也必須非常好。我必須有機會接觸到與商業相關的機會和某些經驗，才能讓這個轉變更容易。我意識到我目前的自己在某些方面有所欠缺。我的時間管理技能相當不錯，但我的優先排序技能就不那麼好了。我在商業方面有一些經驗，而且我已經做了很多學習指導，但我從未真正完全投入創業的角色。我缺乏許多那些能讓這個轉變對我來說更容易的經驗和機會。

後來，當我進行力場分析時，我意識到我的網絡中有很多朋友，我有很多資源可以幫助我實現這個目標。所以，大約9到10個月的時間裡，我開始更多地嘗試，並在商業方面獲得了一些經驗。其中一件聽起來有點好笑的事情是，對於一個想全職創業的人來說，儘管我當時已經經營教育和學習指導業務六年半了，但我從未真正從中支付過自己薪水，因為大部分工作實際上是透過一個非營利組織完成的，我為教育設立了一個慈善機構。所以，我從未真正支付過自己薪水。因此，在過去的幾年裡，我開始實際支付自己薪水，然後看看當我支付自己生活工資時，我是否能管理好我的業務財務。

我正在解釋的這個過程，也就是我如何利用這些過程中的洞察力來制定我的計劃，就是**第五步：建立你的計劃**。在最後這一步，我們知道我們需要達到什麼目標，我們有我們的目標，我們有我們的元目標，我們知道我們目前的立場，我們也知道哪些因素可以推動和拉動我們朝著目標前進。現在剩下的就是弄清楚首先要優先關注什麼，什麼時候開始做，以及如何做。

如果你意識到最落後、你認為需要最長時間才能解決的問題是你的學習技能，那麼這就成為了「要關注什麼」。至於「什麼時候」，假設立即開始是最好的時機。然後「如何」呢？如果你不知道如何做，那麼這又成為了下一步顯而易見的步驟：學習如何做。你知道你需要努力，你知道這很重要，你知道這是優先事項。你不知道如何做，並不能改變它需要努力的事實。

有時候，「什麼、何時、如何」並不是你所期望的。幾年前我與一位大學生合作，她當時在大學裡很掙扎，她的學習技能確實有很多需要改進的地方。她需要達到的目標與她目前的自我之間存在巨大差距，填補這個差距對她來說將是高度優先事項。所以我們試圖填補這個差距，然後嘗試了幾週後，我意識到她不是很一致或勤奮。我意識到我給她設定了任務，說「嘿，這是你需要做的來訓練你的技能」，然後一週後她回來，幾乎沒有練習過任何東西，她停滯不前。

在深入挖掘並進行更多對話後，我意識到她實際上在家裡受到了父母的嚴重虐待。那個家庭環境是有毒的。所以優先事項改變了。當你沒有穩定和安全的基礎時，你無法專注於學習技能。所以我們完全改變了計劃。首要任務變成了：我們如何支持她，讓她離開那個家？阻礙是什麼？她沒有工作。所以我們想辦法讓她找到一份工作，只要賺夠錢搬出去就好。因為兼職工作確實會佔用學習時間，但從長遠來看，它讓許多其他事情變得更容易，所以這才是我們必須解決的瓶頸。

一個月後，她搬了出去，找到了一份工作，搬了出去，找到了一個合租的地方。那不是最好的地方，但對她來說，那是一個改變人生的舉動。當她有更多的心理空間去思考學習技能的事情時，我們又重新開始了。幾年後，她茁壯成長，正在攻讀健康科學碩士學位。對她來說，這是一條充滿挑戰的道路，但她能夠克服，因為她理解了「要專注於什麼、何時專注、如何專注」，並且保持靈活，理解你認為你需要做的事情來實現目標，可能並不是你真正需要的，如果你只是退一步，全面評估情況。

在一個不那麼極端的例子中，我經常看到這樣的情況：人們認為他們需要提高學習技能，但實際上阻礙他們最大的因素是他們總是拖延，或者他們不願意嘗試新事物。所以你可以看到，這實際上是一個根本性的阻礙。在最後這一步，我們正在制定計劃，這將成為「要專注於什麼」：努力提高我們的實驗能力，努力解決我們的拖延問題。這些東西最終會進入你的日程表。每天，你都知道有一件事對你來說是高度優先的，那就是發展你的技能、特質、過程和習慣，以及你獲得機會和資源的能力，你知道這些會讓你朝著目標前進。然後你將這些安排到你的日常、晚上和週末中，這就成為你的計劃。隨著你個人的成長，你自然能夠實現的成果也會隨之增長。

現在，我必須提到一件事，那就是改變你的技能和習慣並不是一件快速或容易的事情。它需要時間，需要勤奮，它可能比你預期的要花更長的時間。你同時嘗試改進的事情越多，改進其中任何一項就越困難。所以，當你規劃你的時間線時，請確保它是一個現實的時間線。對於你認為發展和培養技能所需的時間，要保守一些，特別是如果這些是你已經維持多年的習慣，改變它們需要一些時間。

對我來說，在那段從醫學轉型的時期，我每個月只會專注於一到兩件事。儘管我知道還有10件其他事情需要處理，但我故意阻止自己去處理它們，以確保我給自己最大的成功機會。大約一年，也就是9到10個月後，我能夠相對順利地從醫學轉型。事實上，我的所有朋友，所有和我一起上大學的人，都開始給我發訊息說：「嘿，賈斯汀，你是怎麼做到的？我也一直在考慮辭去醫生或藥劑師的工作。」他們說：「你真幸運，還有那個事業可以依靠。」如果這就是運氣，那麼它似乎比你想像的更容易控制。

這就是逆向目標設定。如果你以前從未這樣設定過目標，那麼它會非常不同。但如果你以前在傳統目標設定方面遇到過困難，那麼你至少應該給它一個機會。我會說，我現在幾乎從不使用傳統目標設定了。如果一個目標對我來說足夠重要和複雜，需要我去設定，我就會使用逆向目標設定。希望這對你有幫助，謝謝觀看，我們下次見。
