raise your hand if you have recently had
to introduce yourself or make small talk
yes that is what today is all about how
to speak better in the moment my hunch
is for many of you introducing
yourselves and making small talk at some
points was challenging it's awkward it
can be uncomfortable so today I want to
talk about how we can think faster and
talk smarter in those moments where
we're put on the spot to think and act
quickly we all know that speaking in
planned
situations presentations pitches
meetings with agendas can be hard but it
can be much harder to speak in the
moment and if you think about it most of
our communication happens in the moment
it's things like making a toast
answering questions giving feedback
introducing yourself answering questions
these are the things that can be very
challenging for us so today I'd like to
walk you through a methodology that I
developed in service of needs of our
students here at
Stanford many years ago the Deans came
to me and said we have a problem the
problem is this our very bright Stanford
MBA students are struggling to answer
those cold call questions from their
professors you remember back here when
people would say what do you think and
you had to respond
so I did a deep dive into research in
Psychology anthropology sociology
improvization neuroscience and came up
with a methodology now that all Stanford
mbas within the first three weeks of
their time here have an opportunity to
take and it turns out it helps them feel
more comfortable and confident not just
answering questions but in standing up
in class and giving a position and many
other situations that they find
themselves in when they leave here
interviewing for jobs giving feedback to
employees Etc so today is going to be
not just listening to me but it's going
to be
participative and we're going to start
it's not hard some of you looking at
each other going oh no what's he going
to make me do pretty simple I'd like you
all to read this sentence and what's
more important to me than the meaning of
the sentence is I'd like for you to
count the number of FS the letter F how
many FS do you find I'll give you three
or four seconds to do it keep the answer
quiet to yourself how many
FS I wish my MBA students were as quiet
and thoughtful as you are right
now all
right all right raise your hand if you
found three FS how many found three
excellent very good anybody find four ah
anybody found five how about six there
are six FS what two-letter word ending
in f did many of us
Miss so why do I do this activity I have
done this in every Workshop every
keynote I ever deliver
why because this is an exact analogy of
what we're going to be doing here today
many of us miss little things that make
a big difference in our
communication now the other reason I do
this is 14 years ago when I first saw
this I found three I felt really stupid
and I like to pass that
that's so we're going to identify little
things that make a big difference
difference to make us more effective in
our spontaneous speaking so I want to
introduce you to a six-step methodology
that we can use to become better at
speaking in the moment and the six steps
divide into two categories mindset and
messaging the first step has to do with
managing anxiety taming the anxiety
Beast most people get nervous speaking
in spontaneous situations in fact most
people get nervous speaking in any high
stake situation we have some research
that says upwards of 85% of people feel
nervous in high stake situations and I
think the other 15% are lying so let me
ask you this how do you feel when you
watch a nervous speaker present now I
know a few of you probably like watching
people suffer but most of us don't how
does it feel just shut out how do how do
you feel when you see a nervous speaker
present okay so
uncomfortable empathetic and I heard
some people say I actually feel an
anxious myself I call that secondhand
anxiety so if for no other reason we
should learn to manage our anxiety so
our audience can focus on us and not be
distracted so when it comes to managing
anxiety we have to take a two-pronged
approach we have to manage both symptoms
and
sources symptoms are the things that we
physiologically experience what goes on
in our body and sources are the things
that initiate or exacerbate that
anxiety so I'd like i' like to hear from
some of you what happens for you when
you get nervous when you're put on the
spot I'll start I blush and I perspire
what happens for some of you my mouth
goes mouth goes dry I call this Plumbing
reversal what's normally dry gets wet
and what's normally wet gets dry so you
get sweaty Palms but dry mouth really
weird right what else happens my brain
goes yeah you freeze you can't remember
what to say what else happens please
heart yeah you feel your heart pounding
right some of us get shaky these are
normal and natural responses to
anxiety your body sees speaking in the
moment as being under threat and it
invokes the fight ORF flight response
and these are normal and natural
responses but there are things we can do
to address these now allow me to share a
few with you the first and best thing
you can probably do is to take a deep
belly breath the kind of breath you
would take if you've ever done yoga or
or taii or chiong a deep belly breath
and what's interesting is it's the
exhale that's more important than the
inhale so my rule of thumb or shall I
say my rule of lung is you want your
exhale to be twice as long as your
inhale and if you take two or three of
these deep belly breaths you'll actually
reduce the rapid heart rate the rapid
breathing that causes you to speak
faster and you'll feel calmer so before
you walk into a room where you think you
might be asked for feedback or you know
questions are coming or before you
unmute on that Zoom take this deep belly
breath and it will
help now if you get dry mouth and you
know you're going into a situation where
you might have to speak in the moment
drink some warm water suck on a Loz or
chew some gum obviously you don't want
to do that while you're in the midst of
speaking but that will help reactivate
those salivary glands if you're like me
and you blush and you perspire hold
something cold in the palms of your hand
the palms of your hand are Thermo
Regulators for your body just like your
forehead or the back of your neck if
you've ever had a fever and you put a
cold compress on your head to cool down
because your heart rate is going up
because your body tenses when you're
stressed you have more blood going
through tighter tubes your blood
pressure goes up and that causes you to
get hotter it's like you're
exercising so we can reduce the sweating
and the blushing by cooling ourselves
down in fact before I start Ed speaking
today I was holding a cold bottle of
water to help so these are some of the
things we can do to manage our symtoms
of anxiety if I didn't talk about a
symptom you have there are resources
I'll share at the end of the talk that
can help you find ways to manage your
anxiety now there's another side too we
have to think about sources sources are
the things that initiate or exacerbate
our anxiety there are many let me talk
about
one many of us are made nervous by the
goal of what we're trying to achieve
when we
communicate my students want to get a
good grade the entrepreneurs I coach
want to get funding you might want to
get a new job or you might want to get
your project supported so what makes you
nervous is the fact that you might not
achieve that goal in other words what's
making you nervous is a potential
negative future
outcome so how do we short circuit that
we become very present oriented because
if you're in the moment
by definition you're not worried about
the future so how do we get present
oriented one way is to do something
physical walk around the building before
you go in for that job interview another
way is to listen to a song or a playlist
just like athletes do you can do what I
do I get present oriented by talking to
people before I got up here on stage I
was talking with many of you that helps
me get present oriented I can't engage
in a conversation and be thinking about
what might go wrong in my presentation
or Q&A
session start at 100 and count backwards
by
17s that'll get you present oriented I
know I'm in front of a crowd that's
trying the first one's easy 83 the next
one's hard my favorite way to get
present oriented is to say tongue
twisters you can't say a tongue twister
right and not be in the present moment
some of you are going uhoh that's right
I'm going to ask you to say my favorite
tongue twister I said this tongue
twister right before I walked out here
it warms me up and it gets me present
oriented many of us assume that we can
just go from Silence to Brilliance
without warming up our voices but you
know if you've ever played a sport or
exercised or played a musical instrument
you should warm up
first so let's try it my favorite tongue
twister takes 5 Seconds to say has three
phrases and if you say one of the
phrases wrong you'll say a naughty word
so I'm listening to here okay let's try
it repeat after me I slit a sheet
SL she a sheet I slit a she I slit and
on that slitted sheet I
sit excellent nobody said that naughty
word and I'm sure you all know what it
is so by managing our anxiety both
symptoms and sources we prepare
ourselves to be better when we speak in
the
moment the second step in our process
has to do with maximizing
mediocrity we get in our own way I have
the audacity in front of my Stanford MBA
students on the first day of class to
say maximize
mediocrity their jaws drop they've never
been told to be
mediocre but why do I recommend this it
boils down to this we are the biggest
impediment to our ability to speak
spontaneously in the moment we get in
our own way and we do it through all the
judging and evaluating that we do of the
material that we're thinking about
saying we get in our head here's why
this is problematic think of your brain
as a computer this is not a Perfect
Analogy but for this point it works you
know on your laptops or your phones when
you have a lot of apps and windows open
how the performance of each one of those
is a little less good because the others
are
open that's because the bandwidth is
less the same is true with your brain
when I am evaluating and judging
everything I'm saying as I'm saying it I
have less cognitive bandwidth to focus
on what I'm actually saying so when we
are evaluating ourselves as we're
speaking we're doing ourselves a
disservice now be very clear I am not
saying you should never judge or
evaluate your speaking you should but we
can turn the volume down a little bit to
give us more resources so we can be more
present and be more effective in what
we're saying so the true sentence that I
tell my students at the end I start with
maximize mediocrity and then I end the
class by saying maximize mediocrity so
you can achieve greatness if you give
yourself permission just to answer the
question just to give the feedback just
to have the small talk then you put
yourself in a position to do it very
well but when I say to myself I have to
give the right answer the best feedback
I need to be the most interesting in
small talk it reduces the likelihood
that you'll do those well so Step One is
manage anxiety step two is turn down
that volume on that mental observation
and evaluation we're doing and that puts
you in a position to be more present and
more
engaged the third step of the
methodology has to do with the fact that
many of us see speaking in the moment
and in general as threatening and
challenging if I were to tell any of you
at the end of the meeting you're running
that you're going to get some questions
from your audience many of you aren't
like oh that's great I can't wait you
say oh no I better do a good job I'm
afraid they're going to see what I said
is wrong they're going to challenge me
many of us see these situations as
threatening and
challenging and when we do so it impacts
not just what we say but how we say it
we tend to retreat we make ourselves
small our answers are Curt our tone is
Harsh because we feel we have to defend
there's another way to approach this and
before I share with you that way and
give you some tools I want you to
actually have an experience of it so I'm
going to ask you to play a very simple
improvisation game with me it's called
give a
gift all of us in our lives have had the
experience of giving a gift and getting
a gift so you know how to play this game
but we're going to practice I'd like
everybody to take out an imaginary box
will you do this with me please here's
your imaginary box on the count of three
I'd like you to just practice giving it
and then give to give the gift you just
extend your arms everybody ready 1 2 3
give a gift perfect very good now when
you receive a gift you do it in reverse
ready 1 two three you've received a gift
perfect so here's what we're going to do
in a moment I'm going to ask you to find
somebody sitting near you you're simply
going to introduce yourself if you don't
know and you're going to play the give a
gift game one of you will give a gift to
your partner your partner will take the
imaginary gift open the box look inside
look at the partner and say thank you
for the and you're going to say the
first that pops into your head so you
might say thank you for the car thank
you for the pen thank you for the
airplane it doesn't even have to fit in
the Box your partner who gave you the
imaginary gift upon hearing it is going
to explain to you why they gave it to
you do you see how there are two acts of
spontaneity that happen in this activity
and then you'll switch so again when
it's your turn to give you give the gift
your partner receives the gift they open
up the box they look inside and they
thank you for the first first thing that
comes to mind by show of hands how many
of you already know what's in your box
ahuh over half of you raised your hands
yes remember what I said in the previous
step how we want to do well and we want
to make sure we're right so you've okay
I know there's going to be a dog bone in
my box that's perfect I'm done I want
you literally when you open up the box
to say the first thing that comes to
your mind I have to tell my MBA students
to keep it clean and keep it legal I'm
sure I don't have to tell you that here
but I want you to name it and then your
partner upon hearing it is immediately
going to explain and then you're going
to switch this activity should take 2
minutes I will ask you to come back in
about two minutes so find somebody
sitting next to you introduce yourself
the person who woke up earliest this
morning goes first I learned a long time
ago as a teacher if you don't say who
goes first everybody argues on it all
right find a
person thank you by the way for doing
this activity I saw lots of of
smiles looks like you were having fun I
am simply going to move my arm across
the audience and as my hand points in
your general direction will you just
call out what you found in your box I
just I love hearing what people gave
themselves just start shouting out what
you gave yourselves Kleenex
tires okay catnip I heard yes pumpkin
notes did I hear broccoli oh
yes
dog poop okay yes sweater excellent you
guys gave yourself wonderful
gifts it's a bit of a rack test too it
tells us a little bit about you but we
won't go
there let me ask you this how did it
feel when you gave the gift and you were
waiting to hear what you gave many of
you looked excited I see many of you SM
what did I give what did I
give and then all of you embraced a rule
that comes from improvisation I am a
huge fan of improv and I have had
wonderful improv teachers here on this
campus Patricia Ryan Madson Adam Tobin
Dan kleene these are improv experts
who've taught me the value of improv and
all of you just executed the number one
rule of improv yes and you didn't say I
did not give you a dog bone no you said
of course I did and here's why right you
embraced it right
away what if what if when somebody asked
you a question or asked you for feedback
you saw it as an opportunity just like
you saw this activity as an opportunity
now I am not naive I know sometimes
people when they ask us questions or ask
us for feedback they're really putting
us on the spot they want to challenge us
they're coming after us but even in
those moments if I can see it as an
opportunity to connect to learn to find
some area of commonality it can change
change everything I will step in I will
be bigger in my response my tone will be
more collaborative my answers will be
more detailed by seeing spontaneous
communication as an opportunity as a
gift not a threat it changes our entire
approach so how do we do this how do we
execute on it on the new book I wrote
thinking faster talking sper I introduce
several tools we can use to see things
as
opportunities the first comes from this
notion of growth mindset which Carol D
on this campus helped to develop and
champions it's wonderful and her work is
fantastic one area of her work in growth
mindset which really essentially says
that when we are faced with a challenge
that doesn't go necessarily the way we
want it to we can learn and grow and
begin to get better at that versus a
fixed mindset which says that's just how
we're built that's just the way it is a
growth mindset again opens to
opportunity and one aspect of it that I
really resonate with is this notion of
not
yet just because something didn't go the
way you want to doesn't mean it never
will go the way you want it just means
not yet maybe you don't have the skills
you don't have the
practice but it means you can get there
so by adopting a not yet mindset it
helps us see things as opportun unties
opportunities to learn opportunities to
grow so when you meet with a frustration
in your life especially around
communication say to yourself not yet
we've already talked about yes and yes
and is where we see the possibility of
connection so even if you're in
disagreement in a negotiation that's
happening in the moment you can look for
those areas of commonality where is it
that we agree where is the yes and from
there
build the third of these comes from the
world of basketball
many of you are familiar with Mike
Shashi former basketball coach Coach K
one of the things he has credited with
instilling in his players but in all of
sport is this notion of next play if
you're an athlete say a basketball
player and you miss a
shot instead of ruminating and getting
frustrated with yourself move on to the
next play because the reality is if I
miss my shot and I sit there thinking
about how bad it was how I should have
made it the play is already ensuing and
the other team might be scoring a shot I
have to move to next play and the same
is true when you're in the midst of a
conversation Small Talk feedback
situation if something happens that
doesn't go exactly the way you want it
to next play keep
moving now while rumination in the
moment is bad reflection after the fact
is very
good so I'd love for you in the moment
to move to the next play but later that
day reflect what worked and what
didn't many of us treat our
communication as that definition of
insanity you know doing the same thing
over and over again expecting different
results if you don't reflect and learn
and think about it you're not going to
change so in the moment next play later
in the day reflection and then the final
of these
steps has us reframing the way we think
about
mistakes many of us try to avoid
mistakes we feel a mistake is a bad
thing now if you think about it we learn
through mistakes if you watch kids as
they develop they make lots of mistakes
and that's how they learn we can take
benefit from that as well but we have to
look at them differently rather than
mistakes I'd like you to think of them
as missed takes you know in television
and film directors will have their
actors do multiple takes of the same
scene you've seen that clapboard that
says take one take two
no one scene is wrong they're just
trying to optimize and try different
things so when you do something that
doesn't go the way you want think to
yourself take two I'm just going to do
it again differently it wasn't bad it
wasn't wrong I'm just going to try it
differently and if you take that
approach to your actions and the things
that don't go the way you want one it
keeps you in a much more positive frame
of reference and it encourages you to
think and learn learn from what just
happened so these four tools not yet yes
and next play and missed takes are the
ways in which we can look at our
communication in the moment as
opportunities and not
threats so we get out of our own
way after we manage anxiety we see
things as being opportunities not
threats and then our fourth step has to
do with
listening most most of us are not good
listeners we listen just enough to get
the gist of what somebody is saying and
then start thinking judging evaluating
rehearsing what we want to say we don't
listen
deeply and if you don't listen deeply
when you're communicating in the moment
you can make some errors imagine this we
walk out of a meeting together you turn
to me and you say how do you think that
went I hear feedback and I start listing
all the things that we did wrong all the
things you could have done better how we
can make sure that we don't make the
same errors next time but had I really
listened in that moment I might have
noticed you came out the back door not
the front door you were looking down and
talking more quietly than you usually do
in that moment what you wanted was not
feedback but you wanted
support and by virtue of giving you all
this constructive feedback I actually
did you a disservice and might have
damage the relationship we have so we
need to listen in a very different way
when we have have to speak spontaneously
so we really understand what's needed in
the moment so I'd like to give you some
advice about how to listen better and I
have to caveat this that my wife gets
really upset when I teach listening
because she says I'm still a work in
progress so listen to what I say not
necessarily what I do first when you are
listening you need to listen intently I
heard a professor at another University
say he was he he was a he taught music
and he was talking about jazz and he had
a jazz teacher and I have to look this
guy up to get his name but he said we
need to listen until you
sweat and I love that approach we
listening is hard work so the first
thing we need to do is when somebody's
speaking we have to listen to what's the
bottom line of what they're saying
what's the Crux of what they're trying
to get
across and then second we need to employ
a strategy that I learned from a
colleague here his name is Collins dobs
and Collins teaches critical and crucial
conversations here at the business
school and he has a methodology to help
do that and that methodology applies
beautifully to listening it's three
things Pace space
Grace to listen well you have to give
yourself a little bit of each of those
we have to slow things down the world
moves very quickly we've got a lot going
on if I slow down I can listen better so
the first step is to slow things down
second you have to give yourself space
sometimes it's physical space move to a
location where you can actually hear
better as I get older everything is
louder in the Ambient sound move to a
place where you can actually hear but
also mental space give yourself
permission to be present oriented In
This Moment listening to this person and
then finally grace and grace is to give
yourself permission to pay attention to
what's going on in the
environment how the person says what
they say not just what they say and
Grace refers to listening to your own
intuition We Have Heard lots of things
we have seen lots of things in our lives
and we get intuitions that come to us
based on what we hear and respect those
as well we often think listening is only
what's coming in but you can also listen
to what's happening inside you so but
with a little bit of pace space and
Grace and focusing on the Crux of what
somebody is saying you can listen
better one of the best tools we can use
to listen better is to ask either
clarifying questions or to
paraphrase we have this notion that we
have to respond in the moment right away
if I don't respond right away it means
I'm not confident it means I don't know
my stuff and yet we can pause a bit to
actually reflect on what we're listening
to before we
respond so I can literally just take a
pause some of us feel pausing is bad but
pausing can be great I can ask a
clarifying question that gives me a
little bit of time or I can paraphrase
which is where I take something you've
said synthesize it and present it back
to you in a way that's distilled down so
it's not like what a 5-year-old does who
just parrots back what you say that's
annoying but you look for the key idea
and you repeat it back the thing with
asking follow-up questions and
paraphrasing is these are lower order
cognitive skills in other words I can be
thinking about what I want to say next
while I'm doing those
so we're going to do a paraphrasing
activity it's very quick very similar to
what we did with give a gift I in a
moment I'm going to ask you to find a
different partner in the room and I'm
going to ask you to share a story of
your name and it can be anything related
to your name you want it can be very
deep and meaningful it can be fun for 30
seconds you're going to tell a story of
your name this activity is not about
storytelling this activity is about
paraphrasing because the person you're
telling it to is is going to paraphrase
what you said and then they're going to
ask a question because paraphrasing
never happens by itself it's always
followed by something maybe your answer
maybe connecting to the agenda maybe
asking a question so let me give you an
example of what this is like so I'm
going to tell you a story about my name
for 30 seconds I'm going to ask for a
volunteer if you'd like to paraphrase
what I said and then another volunteer
to ask a question now you do not need to
answer the question but by training
yourself to ask a question immediately
after paraphrasing you're training
yourself to keep the conversation moving
paraphrasing is never something you do
in and of itself you always use it to
move on so here's a story of my name my
name is Matt all through my childhood I
was teased mercilessly because Matt
rhymes with everything okay lazy as a
doormat silly as a cat you're fat I was
teased all the time when my wife and I
started our family it was very important
to me that our children not be named
something that was easily
teas as a teacher I have a built-in
focus group so I went into my classroom
I wrote the three names that my wife and
I were willing to call our kids and I
gave my students five minutes to come up
with the most heinous mean bad Rhymes
and everything they could and we named
my
children the names that had the shortest
lists so that's the story of my name is
there somebody here who'be willing to
just paraphrase my story again a
paraphrase gets to the Crux of it I see
your hand here sir
yes that wouldn't happen excellent great
paraphrase essentially what he said for
those of you who couldn't hear is you
stress tested your kids names right
that's a great
paraphrase what is a reasonable question
that you might ask
yes what are the kids' names yes I'm not
going to tell you because they would be
be very upset but I'll tell you that my
kids are not teased because of their
names now they're teased for lots of
other things but not their names do you
see how paraphrasing can actually help
you listen more intently so here's what
I'm going to ask you to do find somebody
else sitting around you introduce
yourself and the person in your
partnership who had to travel the
farthest to get to campus for the event
not this morning if you're not local
you're staying in a hotel that's close
by but where you came from whoever
traveled the farthest will go first
you'll tell a 30second story about your
name your partner will immediately
paraphrase and ask a question you need
not answer it and then you'll switch
this should take us two minutes to do
find a partner tell a story of your
name how did it feel to have your
story
paraphrased it feels good doesn't it it
feels good to have your story
paraphrased
it feels good to be listened
to now we're not virtual in this room so
we don't have some of those cool
features that you have on tools like
zoom and teams and meet so we're going
to do it all the oldfashioned way will
everybody put your fist out like this
this is a yes thumbs up yes thumbs down
no no middle
fingers did your
partner paraphrase well
your story of your name I am seeing
almost exclusively thumbs up I see one
sideways and we might have one thumbs
down but there's always one in every
credit
no how did it feel how did it feel to
listen to
paraphrase how did it feel to do
this hard right I see thumbs up but it
was hard right you had to listen in a
different way when I looked at all of
you doing this you were leaning in you
were nodding it was clear that you were
listening with intensity we have the
capability to listen well but we have to
encourage ourselves to do it and when we
speak spontaneously it is critical to
listen well so we've now completed the
first four steps of the process manage
anxiety get out of Our Own Way see it as
an opportunity listen well all of this
has to do with mindset we haven't
actually responded in the moment yet so
that's the next part and that's
messaging and messaging has two
components first it has to do with
structure structure is critical how you
put your messages together matters most
of us just ramble and give lists of
information when we're put on the spot
and your brain is not wired for lists
it's very hard for us to remember just
ramblings our brains are actually wired
for structure for story a story to me a
stru structure is nothing more than a
logical connection of ideas that has a
beginning a middle and an
end I learned the power of story and the
power of structure When I Was An
undergraduate here at Stanford many many
years ago I was a tour guide on this
campus to this day I can still walk
backwards in a straight line while
speaking they trained us back then for
12
weeks the most important thing they
taught us they said above all else to be
a good tour guide on this campus you
must never ever lose your tour group you
are a bad tour guide if you get people
lost the same is true with us as
spontaneous speakers never lose the
audience you're talking to how do we
keep people together we structure our
responses structure helps us Orient
people in set expectations if I showed
up and I said hi I'm Matt I'm your tour
guide let's go how many of you would go
with me a few because you're adventurous
but the rest of you'd be like heck no
where are we going do I have the right
shoes on should I go to the bathroom
first a good tour guide just like a good
spontaneous speaker sets expectations up
front so you can pay attention to what's
happening and not wonder what's coming
next structure also helps connect ideas
together the biggest place or the most
frequent place you will lose people as a
tour guide is when you move from one
place to the next people just wander
off the same is true in our
communication if you are using words
like so next second third as your
transitions then you are missing
opportunities to keep people together so
structure is really
important let me give you an example of
a structure just so you can get your
arms around it most of us are familiar
with a very persuasive structure of
problem solution benefit if you've ever
ever pitched an idea if you've ever
watched an advertisement This Is How
They Go problem solution benefit here's
an issue here's how we solve it and
here's the benefit that's a structure
beginning middle and an end now my
favorite structure in the whole world is
three simple questions what so what now
what the what is your idea your belief
your position your product your service
your feedback the so is why is it
important to the person you're speaking
to and then now what is what comes next
maybe I'll take your questions let's set
another meeting let me show you a
demonstration what so what now what is a
great way to package up information when
you're meeting with your friends this
weekend and somebody says what are you
up to it's a great structure to update
here's what I'm doing here's why I think
it's important here's what I'm planning
to do next when you're giving feedback
you can give feedback in this structure
the feedback is what I saw or what I
didn't see the so what is why it's
important and the now what is what I'd
like you to do differently so imagine we
come out of a meeting together and you
say Matt how'd that go I say well I
thought it went really well except when
you were talking about the
implementation plan you spoke quickly
and didn't give as much detail as you
did
elsewhere when you speak quickly without
a lot of detail people might think
you're nervous and arn is
prepared next time slow down and use
these two addition examples do you see
how in the moment just by following this
structure it gives me a good
response structure is a tool it's like a
recipe I am a lousy cook but I have have
a much better chance of cooking well if
I follow a recipe so by having a recipe
all I have to do is put the ingredients
into it I know how I'm going to give you
my feedback I just have to think about
what I say in the feedback so structure
helps you not only package up
information for your audience but it
helps you prioritize what to say and
because the information is packaged well
your audience can take that information
and share it elsewhere think of a job
interview when you're being interviewed
not only are you trying to communicate
your skills and how you could benefit
the company but you're trying to equip
your interviewer with the information
that they can then take to the others
involved in the hiring decision and
represent you and if you package up that
information easily they can tell your
story really well if you just give them
a whole list of information they're
likely not to remember it so structure
is incredibly helpful in spontaneous
communication in the new book the whole
second half of it is specific
spontaneous situations making small talk
apologizing giving feedback introducing
yourself answering questions and with
each one I assign or give a structure
that you can
use this is not the final step though
the final step is the F-word of
communication and it's not that naughty
one some of you are thinking about it's
Focus many of us when we speak in the
moment take our audiences on the Journey
of our discovery of what it is we want
to say as we're saying it in other words
we say more than we need to we need to
be focused and concise my mother has a
saying that I love I know she didn't
create it but it's tell me the time
don't build me the clock many of us when
we are spontaneously speaking build
clocks one because we're discovering
what we want to say two because we want
people to think we're really smart and
three we want everybody to see how hard
we've worked to get to what we're saying
it is much better to be Compact and
concise in what you're saying so how do
you do that well one we've already
talked about relevance if I think about
what's really relevant for the audience
then I hinge everything I'm saying on
that relevance
second you should have a goal whenever
you speak be it spontaneous or planned a
goal to me has three parts information
emotion and action what do I want the
audience to know how do I want them to
feel and what do I want them to do so if
I'm walking into a room where I expect
that I will be asked
questions or asked to give feedback or
even making small talk I think to myself
what do I want people to know how do I
want them to feel and what do I want
them to do and that helps me focus and
prioritize what I'm saying
so it's not enough to just have a
structured message you have to focus
that message to help people remember it
and to not be seen as rambling and
giving too much
information there's another structure I
want to introduce you to that is
incredibly focused in concise this is a
structure for pitching I'm often asked
by people what happens if somebody asks
me to pitch an idea in the moment so
you're getting on an elevator and your
boss's boss steps in and they look at
you say oh what are you working on I'm
about to go speak with the board maybe I
can help you you got to respond four
sentence starters you just finish these
sentences what if you could so that for
example and that's not all what if you
could so that for example and that's not
all let me show you how this works by
taking a suggestion from you all and
I'll put it in this structure and then
together as a group we're going to use
this for something can somebody think of
a product or service that you would like
to hear a pitch
for what would you like to hear me give
a pitch for somebody suggest one your
book my book well look at that well
right I appreciate that so my new book
is all about how to speak more
effectively in the moment what if you
could feel more comfortable and
confident when put on the spot so that
you could answer questions well or give
appropriate feedback for example imagine
an upcoming job interview that you nail
that you get all of your points across
in a way that really represents who you
are and that's not all you can apply
these principles to small talk to
apologizing and to even introducing
yourself do you see how just answering
those sentences gets you to a tight
clear
pitch so here's what we're going to do
for all of you to practice and thank you
for that opportunity
okay all of us are here for our Stamford
reunion let's imagine for your next
reunion you volunteer to help recruit
people to come back to campus for
reunion so you're going to make a pitch
let's go through each of these four
together as a group somebody give me a
the end of this sentence what if you
could
could what if you could see old friends
so
that you can walk down memory lane and
and experience the things that you
enjoyed about being on campus for
example somebody give me an example of a
of a memory or an exciting thing you'd
like to share with a old friend for
example here the band hear the band play
and sing some of the old songs and
that's not all
and that's not all you
what you can go to a great lecture on
communicating in the moment I love it do
you see how easy that was do you see how
the structure helps you and it made it
very
concise so by focusing on these two
messaging elements structure and focus
you can actually be much better at
speaking in the
moment so some resources for you to
continue learning these Concepts and and
others I host a podcast for the business
school it's called think fast talk smart
it's all about communication skills I
get to interview experts from around
campus and around the world on how to be
a better
communicators lots of your favorite
faculty have been guests on the show and
this show I'm proud to say has won many
prestigious Awards including best dog
walking podcast and best commute podcast
because our episodes are very concise
and short 20 minutes we've won some
other ones as well I and there's a
picture of the book think faster talk
smarter if you take a a shot of this QR
code it'll take you to a whole bunch of
resources that I make available to our
students here and elsewhere I encourage
all of you to think about how you can be
a better in the- moment speaker it takes
time and it takes practice the only way
you get better at communication planned
or spontaneous is three things
repetition reflection and feedback
repetition reflection and feedback
you have to practice you have to think
about what's working and what's not
working and you have to seek out advice
and guidance from teachers from
colleagues from mentors to help that's
how we get
better

[Timestamp: 2025/11/16 16:38:06]

**ai**: 好的，這是翻譯成繁體中文的內容：

請舉手，如果你最近需要自我介紹或進行閒聊。
是的，這就是今天的主題：如何在當下更好地表達。我的猜想是，對你們許多人來說，自我介紹和閒聊在某些時候是具有挑戰性的，它會讓人感到尷尬和不舒服。所以今天我想談談，在那些需要我們快速思考和行動的時刻，我們如何能更快地思考，更聰明地說話。我們都知道，在有計劃的場合，例如演講、提案、有議程的會議，說話可能很困難，但在當下說話會更困難。如果你仔細想想，我們大部分的溝通都發生在當下。這包括敬酒、回答問題、給予回饋、自我介紹、回答問題，這些都是對我們來說非常具有挑戰性的事情。所以今天我想帶你們了解我多年前為滿足史丹佛學生需求而開發的一套方法。當時院長們來找我說：「我們有個問題，我們的史丹佛MBA學生在回答教授們的突擊提問時遇到了困難。」你們還記得以前人們會說「你怎麼看？」而你必須回應。
於是我深入研究了心理學、人類學、社會學、即興表演和神經科學，並提出了一套方法。現在，所有史丹佛MBA學生在入學前三週都有機會學習這套方法，結果證明它不僅幫助他們在回答問題時感到更自在和自信，還幫助他們在課堂上站起來表達立場，以及在他們離開學校後，例如求職面試、給予員工回饋等許多其他情況下，都能感到更自在和自信。所以今天不僅僅是聽我說，還會是互動式的，我們會從一個簡單的練習開始。有些人看著彼此說：「哦不，他要我做什麼？」其實很簡單，我想請你們所有人讀這句話，對我來說，比這句話的意義更重要的是，我想請你們數一數字母F的數量。你們找到了多少個F？我給你們三到四秒鐘。請把答案悄悄地告訴自己。有多少個F？我希望我的MBA學生能像你們現在這樣安靜和深思熟慮。
好了，好了，請舉手如果你找到了三個F。有多少人找到了三個？太棒了，非常好。有沒有人找到四個？啊，有沒有人找到五個？那六個呢？有六個F。我們許多人錯過了哪個以F結尾的兩個字母的詞？那麼我為什麼要做這個活動呢？我在我所做的每一個工作坊、每一次主題演講中都做過這個活動。
為什麼？因為這正是我們今天要做的事情的精確類比。我們許多人錯過了一些小細節，而這些小細節在我們的溝通中卻能產生巨大的影響。我做這個的另一個原因是，14年前我第一次看到這個時，我只找到了三個，我覺得自己很笨，我想把這種感覺傳遞下去。
所以我們要找出那些能產生巨大影響的小細節，讓我們在即興演講中更有效率。所以我想向你們介紹一個六步驟的方法，我們可以利用它來更好地在當下說話。這六個步驟分為兩個類別：心態和訊息。第一個步驟與管理焦慮、馴服焦慮怪獸有關。大多數人在即興場合說話時會感到緊張，事實上，大多數人在任何高風險場合說話時都會感到緊張。我們有一些研究表明，高達85%的人在高風險場合會感到緊張，我認為另外15%的人在撒謊。所以讓我問你們，當你們看到一個緊張的演講者時，你們感覺如何？我知道你們中有些人可能喜歡看別人受苦，但我們大多數人都不喜歡。感覺如何？就說出來吧，當你們看到一個緊張的演講者時，你們感覺如何？好的，所以會感到不舒服、有同理心，我聽到有些人說他們自己也會感到焦慮，我稱之為二手焦慮。所以，如果沒有其他原因，我們也應該學會管理我們的焦慮，這樣我們的聽眾才能專注於我們，而不是分心。所以當談到管理焦慮時，我們必須採取雙管齊下的方法，我們必須同時管理症狀和來源。症狀是我們生理上經歷的事情，發生在我們身體裡的事情，而來源是引發或加劇焦慮的事情。所以我想聽聽你們中一些人的意見，當你們感到緊張、被突然提問時，你們會發生什麼？我先說，我會臉紅和出汗。你們中有些人會發生什麼？我的嘴巴會變乾，我稱之為「水管逆轉」，通常乾燥的地方會變濕，通常濕潤的地方會變乾，所以你會手心出汗，但嘴巴卻很乾，真的很奇怪，對吧？還會發生什麼？我的大腦會，是的，你會僵住，想不起要說什麼。還會發生什麼？請說，心臟，是的，你會感覺到心臟砰砰跳，對吧？我們有些人會發抖，這些都是對焦慮的正常和自然反應。你的身體將在當下說話視為受到威脅，並會引發戰鬥或逃跑反應，這些都是正常和自然的反應，但我們有一些事情可以做來解決這些問題。現在讓我與你們分享一些。第一個也是最好的方法，你可能可以做的是深呼吸，那種如果你曾經做過瑜伽、太極或氣功時會做的深腹式呼吸。有趣的是，呼氣比吸氣更重要。所以我的經驗法則，或者我應該說我的肺部法則，是你的呼氣要比吸氣長兩倍。如果你做兩到三次這樣的深腹式呼吸，你實際上會減慢心率、減慢呼吸，這會導致你說話更快，你會感到更平靜。所以在你走進一個你認為可能會被要求提供回饋或知道問題即將到來的房間之前，或者在你解除Zoom靜音之前，做這個深腹式呼吸，它會有所幫助。現在，如果你嘴巴乾燥，並且知道自己將要進入一個可能需要即興說話的場合，喝一些溫水，含一顆喉糖或嚼口香糖。顯然，你在說話時不應該這樣做，但這會幫助重新激活唾液腺。如果你像我一樣會臉紅和出汗，手心握著一些冰冷的東西。你的手心是身體的溫度調節器，就像你的額頭或脖子後面一樣。如果你曾經發燒，你會在頭上敷冷敷布來降溫，因為你的心率會加快，因為當你感到壓力時，你的身體會緊張，更多的血液會流過更緊的血管，你的血壓會升高，這會導致你感到更熱，就像你在運動一樣。所以我們可以通過冷卻自己來減少出汗和臉紅。事實上，在我今天開始說話之前，我一直握著一瓶冰水來幫助自己。所以這些是我們可以做的一些事情來管理我們的焦慮症狀。如果我沒有談到你有的症狀，我會在演講結束時分享一些資源，可以幫助你找到管理焦慮的方法。現在還有另一方面，我們必須考慮來源。來源是引發或加劇我們焦慮的事情。有很多，讓我談談其中一個。我們許多人會因為我們在溝通時試圖實現的目標而感到緊張。我的學生想要取得好成績，我指導的企業家想要獲得資金，你可能想要獲得一份新工作，或者你可能想要你的專案獲得支持。所以讓你緊張的事實是，你可能無法實現那個目標。換句話說，讓你緊張的是潛在的負面未來結果。那麼我們如何縮短這個過程呢？我們變得非常專注於當下，因為如果你活在當下，根據定義，你就不會擔心未來。那麼我們如何專注於當下呢？一種方法是做一些身體活動，在面試前繞著大樓走一走。另一種方法是聽一首歌或一個播放列表，就像運動員一樣。你可以做我做的事情，我通過與人交談來專注於當下。在我上台之前，我與你們許多人交談過，這幫助我專注於當下。我無法在進行對話的同時思考我的演講或問答環節可能會出什麼問題。從100開始倒數17，這會讓你專注於當下。我知道我面對的是一群正在嘗試的人，第一個很簡單，83，下一個很難。我最喜歡的專注於當下的方法是說繞口令。你不可能說繞口令說得對，卻不在當下。你們中有些人會說：「糟糕，」沒錯，我要請你們說我最喜歡的繞口令。我在上台前就說了這個繞口令，它讓我熱身，也讓我專注於當下。我們許多人認為我們可以從沉默直接跳到精彩，而不需要熱身我們的聲音，但你們知道，如果你曾經運動或演奏樂器，你應該先熱身。
所以我們來試試看。我最喜歡的繞口令需要5秒鐘說完，有三個短語，如果你說錯其中一個短語，你就會說出一個不雅的詞。所以我正在聽，好的，我們來試試看，跟我重複：我切了一張床單，切了一張床單，我切了一張床單，我切了，然後我坐在那張切好的床單上。太棒了，沒有人說出那個不雅的詞，我相信你們都知道是什麼。所以通過管理我們的焦慮，包括症狀和來源，我們為自己在當下說話時表現得更好做好了準備。
我們流程的第二步與最大化平庸有關。我們自己阻礙了自己。我在史丹佛MBA學生開學第一天，竟然大膽地對他們說：「最大化平庸。」他們都驚訝得下巴都掉了，他們從來沒有被告知要平庸。但我為什麼要這樣建議呢？歸根結底就是：我們是阻礙自己在當下即興說話的最大障礙。我們自己阻礙了自己，我們通過對我們正在思考要說的內容進行評判和評估來做到這一點。我們陷入了自己的思維。這就是為什麼這會產生問題。把你的大腦想像成一台電腦，這不是一個完美的類比，但在這一點上它適用。你知道在你的筆記型電腦或手機上，當你打開很多應用程式和視窗時，每個應用程式的性能都會稍微下降，因為其他應用程式也開著。那是因為頻寬變少了。你的大腦也是如此。當我在說話的同時評估和評判我所說的一切時，我用於專注於我實際說的內容的認知頻寬就變少了。所以當我們在說話時評估自己，我們是在幫倒忙。現在請非常清楚，我不是說你永遠不應該評判或評估你的說話，你應該這樣做，但我們可以把音量調低一點，給我們更多的資源，這樣我們就可以更專注，更有效地表達我們所說的內容。所以我最後告訴我學生的那句話，我從「最大化平庸」開始，然後以「最大化平庸，這樣你才能成就偉大」結束。如果你允許自己只是回答問題，只是給予回饋，只是進行閒聊，那麼你就能把它做得很好。但當我對自己說：「我必須給出正確的答案，最好的回饋，我必須在閒聊中最有趣。」這會降低你把這些事情做好的可能性。所以第一步是管理焦慮，第二步是調低我們正在進行的心理觀察和評估的音量，這會讓你處於一個更專注、更投入的位置。
這套方法的第三步與我們許多人將即時說話，甚至一般說話，視為威脅和挑戰的事實有關。如果我在會議結束時告訴你們任何人，你們將會收到觀眾的一些問題，你們許多人不會說：「哦，太棒了，我等不及了！」你們會說：「哦不，我最好好好表現，我怕他們會認為我說錯了，他們會挑戰我。」我們許多人將這些情況視為威脅和挑戰。當我們這樣做時，它不僅影響我們說什麼，還影響我們怎麼說。我們傾向於退縮，我們讓自己變得渺小，我們的回答簡短，我們的語氣嚴厲，因為我們覺得我們必須防禦。還有另一種方法可以處理這個問題，在我與你們分享這種方法並給你們一些工具之前，我想讓你們實際體驗一下。所以我要請你們和我玩一個非常簡單的即興遊戲，叫做「送禮」。我們所有人在生活中都有過送禮和收禮的經驗，所以你們知道怎麼玩這個遊戲，但我們要練習一下。我想請大家拿出一個想像中的盒子，你們願意和我一起做嗎？這是你們想像中的盒子，數到三，我想請你們練習送禮，然後送禮時，你們只需伸出雙臂。大家準備好了嗎？1、2、3，送禮！太棒了，非常好。現在當你收到禮物時，你反過來做。準備好了嗎？1、2、3，你收到禮物了！太棒了。所以我們要這樣做：稍後我會請你們找一個坐在你們附近的人，你們只需自我介紹，如果你們不認識對方，然後你們將玩「送禮」遊戲。你們其中一人會送一份禮物給你們的夥伴，你們的夥伴會拿起想像中的禮物，打開盒子，往裡面看，看著夥伴說：「謝謝你的……」然後你們會說出腦海中第一個想到的東西。所以你可能會說：「謝謝你的車。」「謝謝你的筆。」「謝謝你的飛機。」它甚至不需要裝在盒子裡。你的夥伴，也就是送你想像中禮物的人，聽到後會向你解釋他們為什麼送給你。你們看到這個活動中發生了兩個即興行為嗎？然後你們會交換。所以再次，輪到你送禮時，你送出禮物，你的夥伴收到禮物，他們打開盒子，往裡面看，然後他們會感謝你腦海中第一個想到的東西。舉手示意，你們中有多少人已經知道你們盒子裡有什麼了？啊哈，超過一半的人舉手了。是的，還記得我上一步說過什麼嗎？我們想要做得好，我們想要確保我們是對的。所以你已經：「好的，我知道我的盒子裡會有一根狗骨頭，太完美了，我完成了。」我希望你們在打開盒子時，真的說出你們腦海中第一個想到的東西。我必須告訴我的MBA學生要保持禮貌和合法，我相信我不需要在這裡告訴你們，但我想讓你們說出它，然後你們的夥伴聽到後會立即解釋，然後你們會交換。這個活動應該需要2分鐘。我會請你們大約兩分鐘後回來。所以找一個坐在你們旁邊的人，自我介紹，今天早上最早起床的人先開始。我很久以前作為老師就學到，如果你不說誰先開始，大家都會爭論。好的，找一個人。順便謝謝你們參與這個活動。我看到許多笑容，看起來你們玩得很開心。我只是簡單地將手臂掃過觀眾，當我的手指向你們大致的方向時，你們就喊出你們在盒子裡發現了什麼。我只是喜歡聽人們給自己什麼。就開始喊出你們給自己什麼吧。面紙、輪胎、好的，貓薄荷，我聽到了，是的，南瓜筆記，我聽到了花椰菜嗎？哦，是的，狗屎，好的，是的，毛衣，太棒了，你們給了自己很棒的禮物。這也是一個有點像羅夏測驗，它告訴我們一些關於你們的事情，但我們就不深入探討了。讓我問你們，當你們送出禮物並等待聽到你們送了什麼時，感覺如何？你們許多人看起來很興奮，我看到你們許多人笑了。我送了什麼？我送了什麼？然後你們所有人都接受了一個來自即興表演的規則。我是即興表演的忠實粉絲，我在這個校園裡有很棒的即興表演老師，Patricia Ryan Madson、Adam Tobin、Dan Kleene，這些都是即興表演專家，他們教會了我即興表演的價值，而你們所有人都剛剛執行了即興表演的第一條規則：「是的，而且……」你們沒有說：「我沒有給你狗骨頭。」不，你們說：「當然我給了，這就是為什麼。」對吧？你們立刻接受了它，對吧？如果有人問你一個問題或要求你提供回饋時，你把它看作一個機會，就像你把這個活動看作一個機會一樣，那會怎麼樣？我不是天真的，我知道有時候人們問我們問題或要求我們提供回饋時，他們確實是在刁難我們，他們想挑戰我們，他們在攻擊我們。但即使在那些時刻，如果我能把它看作一個連結、學習、找到一些共同點的機會，它就能改變一切。我會介入，我的回應會更宏大，我的語氣會更具協作性，我的回答會更詳細。通過將即興溝通視為一個機會、一份禮物，而不是威脅，它改變了我們整個方法。那麼我們如何做到這一點呢？我們如何執行它呢？在我寫的新書《更快思考，更聰明說話》中，我介紹了幾個我們可以使用的工具，將事物視為機會。第一個來自成長型思維模式的概念，這是校園裡的Carol Dweck幫助開發和倡導的，它很棒，她的工作也很出色。她成長型思維模式工作的一個方面，它本質上是說，當我們面對一個不一定如我們所願的挑戰時，我們可以學習和成長，並開始在這方面變得更好，而不是固定型思維模式，它說我們就是這樣被塑造的，事情就是這樣。成長型思維模式再次開啟了機會，而我真正認同的一個方面是「還沒」這個概念。僅僅因為某件事沒有如你所願，並不意味著它永遠不會如你所願，它只是意味著「還沒」。也許你還沒有技能，你還沒有練習，但它意味著你可以達到目標。所以通過採用「還沒」的思維模式，它幫助我們將事物視為機會，學習的機會，成長的機會。所以當你在生活中遇到挫折時，尤其是在溝通方面，對自己說：「還沒。」我們已經談過「是的，而且……」。「是的，而且……」是我們看到連結可能性的地方。所以即使你在當下的談判中存在分歧，你也可以尋找那些共同點，我們在哪裡達成一致？「是的，而且……」從那裡建立。第三個來自籃球世界。
你們許多人都熟悉前籃球教練Mike Krzyzewski，K教練。他被認為向他的球員以及所有運動灌輸的一個概念是「下一回合」的概念。如果你是一名運動員，比如籃球運動員，你投失了一球，不要沉思並對自己感到沮喪，而是繼續進行下一回合。因為現實是，如果我投失了球，我坐在那裡想著它有多糟糕，我本來應該投進的，比賽已經在進行中，而對方球隊可能正在得分。我必須轉向下一回合。當你在對話、閒聊、回饋情境中時，也是如此。如果發生了什麼事情沒有完全按照你想要的方式進行，下一回合，繼續前進。現在，雖然當下的沉思是糟糕的，但事後的反思是非常好的。所以我希望你們在當下轉向下一回合，但那天晚些時候，反思一下什麼有效，什麼無效。我們許多人將我們的溝通視為那種瘋狂的定義，你知道，一遍又一遍地做同樣的事情，卻期望不同的結果。如果你不反思、學習和思考，你就不會改變。所以，在當下，下一回合；那天晚些時候，反思。然後這些步驟的最後一步讓我們重新定義我們對錯誤的看法。我們許多人試圖避免錯誤，我們認為錯誤是一件壞事。現在，如果你仔細想想，我們是通過錯誤來學習的。如果你觀察孩子們的成長，他們會犯很多錯誤，這就是他們學習的方式。我們也可以從中受益，但我們必須以不同的方式看待它們。與其說是錯誤，我更希望你們將它們視為「錯失的鏡頭」。你們知道在電視和電影中，導演會讓他們的演員對同一個場景進行多次拍攝。你們看過那個寫著「第一鏡」、「第二鏡」的場記板。
沒有一個場景是錯的，他們只是在嘗試優化和嘗試不同的東西。所以當你做了一些不如你意的事情時，對自己說：「第二鏡。」我只是要用不同的方式再做一次。它不是壞的，也不是錯的，我只是要用不同的方式嘗試。如果你對你的行為和那些不如你意的事情採取這種方法，首先，它會讓你保持一個更積極的參考框架，它會鼓勵你思考和學習，從剛剛發生的事情中學習。所以這四個工具：「還沒」、「是的，而且……」、「下一回合」和「錯失的鏡頭」是我們將當下的溝通視為機會而不是威脅的方式。所以我們擺脫了自己的阻礙。
在我們管理焦慮之後，我們將事物視為機會而不是威脅，然後我們的第四步與傾聽有關。我們大多數人都不擅長傾聽。我們只聽足夠多的內容來理解對方說話的要點，然後就開始思考、評判、評估、排練我們想說的話。我們沒有深入傾聽。如果你在當下溝通時沒有深入傾聽，你可能會犯一些錯誤。想像一下，我們一起走出會議，你轉向我說：「你覺得怎麼樣？」我聽到「回饋」，然後我開始列舉我們做錯的所有事情，所有你可以做得更好的事情，我們如何確保下次不再犯同樣的錯誤。但如果我當時真的傾聽了，我可能會注意到你從後門出來，而不是前門，你低著頭，說話比平時更輕聲。在那一刻，你想要的不是回饋，而是支持。而我給了你所有這些建設性的回饋，實際上卻幫了倒忙，甚至可能損害了我們之間的關係。所以當我們需要即興說話時，我們需要以一種非常不同的方式傾聽，這樣我們才能真正理解當下需要什麼。所以我想給你們一些關於如何更好地傾聽的建議，我必須聲明，我的妻子在我教導傾聽時會非常生氣，因為她說我仍在進步中。所以請聽我說的，而不是我做的。首先，當你傾聽時，你需要專心致志地傾聽。我聽到另一所大學的一位教授說，他教音樂，他談到爵士樂，他有一位爵士樂老師，我必須查一下這個人的名字，但他說我們需要傾聽直到你出汗。我喜歡這種方法，傾聽是一項艱苦的工作。所以我們需要做的第一件事是，當有人說話時，我們必須傾聽他們說話的重點是什麼，他們試圖表達的核心是什麼。然後第二，我們需要採用我從這裡的一位同事那裡學到的一個策略，他的名字是Collins Dobbs，Collins在這裡的商學院教授批判性和關鍵對話，他有一套方法來幫助做到這一點，這套方法非常適用於傾聽。它有三件事：步調、空間、優雅。要好好傾聽，你必須給自己一點這些東西。我們必須放慢速度，世界運轉得很快，我們有很多事情要做，如果我放慢速度，我就可以更好地傾聽。所以第一步是放慢速度。第二，你必須給自己空間。有時候是物理空間，移動到一個你可以更好地聽到聲音的地方。隨著我年紀越來越大，周圍的聲音都變得更響亮，移動到一個你可以真正聽到聲音的地方，但也要給自己心理空間，允許自己在此刻專注於當下，傾聽這個人。然後最後是優雅，優雅是允許自己注意周圍環境中正在發生的事情，對方說話的方式，而不僅僅是他們說什麼。優雅指的是傾聽自己的直覺。我們在生活中聽過很多事情，看過很多事情，我們會根據我們聽到的東西產生直覺，也要尊重這些直覺。我們常常認為傾聽只是接收進來的東西，但你也可以傾聽自己內心正在發生的事情。所以，只要有一點步調、空間和優雅，並專注於對方說話的重點，你就可以更好地傾聽。我們可以用來更好地傾聽的最佳工具之一是提出澄清問題或轉述。我們有這樣一種觀念，認為我們必須立即回應，如果我不立即回應，就意味著我不自信，意味著我不懂我的東西。然而，我們可以稍微停頓一下，在回應之前實際反思我們正在傾聽的內容。所以我可以真的只是停頓一下，我們有些人覺得停頓不好，但停頓可以很棒。我可以問一個澄清問題，這會給我一點時間，或者我可以轉述，也就是我把你說過的話，綜合起來，然後以一種精煉的方式回饋給你。所以它不像一個5歲的孩子只是鸚鵡學舌地重複你說的話，那很煩人，但你要找出關鍵思想並重複回饋。提出後續問題和轉述的重點是，這些是較低階的認知技能。換句話說，我可以在做這些事情的同時思考我接下來想說什麼。
所以我們要進行一個轉述活動，它非常快，與我們之前「送禮」的活動非常相似。稍後我會請你們在房間裡找一個不同的夥伴，我會請你們分享一個關於你們名字的故事，它可以是任何與你們名字相關的事情，你們可以說得很深刻很有意義，也可以很有趣，你們將用30秒講述一個關於你們名字的故事。這個活動不是關於講故事，這個活動是關於轉述，因為你們講故事的對象將會轉述你們說的話，然後他們會問一個問題，因為轉述從來不會單獨發生，它總是會跟著一些事情，可能是你們的答案，可能是連結到議程，可能是問一個問題。所以讓我給你們一個例子，說明這是什麼樣子。所以我要給你們講一個關於我名字的故事，30秒。我會請一位志願者，如果你願意轉述我說的話，然後另一位志願者問一個問題。你們不需要回答問題，但通過訓練自己，在轉述後立即問一個問題，你們就是在訓練自己讓對話繼續下去。轉述從來不是你們單獨做的事情，你們總是會用它來繼續下去。所以這是我名字的故事：我的名字是Matt。我的整個童年時期，我都被無情地嘲笑，因為Matt與所有東西都押韻，好嗎？懶惰如門墊，傻氣如貓，你很胖。我一直被嘲笑。當我和妻子組建家庭時，對我來說非常重要的是，我們的孩子不要取一個容易被嘲笑的名字。作為一名老師，我有一個內建的焦點小組。所以我走進我的教室，寫下我和妻子願意給孩子們取的三個名字，然後我給我的學生五分鐘時間，想出最惡毒、最刻薄、最糟糕的押韻和所有他們能想到的東西。我們給我的孩子們取了清單最短的名字。所以這就是我名字的故事。這裡有人願意轉述我的故事嗎？再次，轉述要抓住重點。我看到你的手在這裡，先生。
是的，那不會發生。太棒了，很棒的轉述。基本上，對於那些聽不到的人來說，他說的是你對你孩子的名字進行了壓力測試，對吧？這是一個很棒的轉述。你會問一個什麼樣的合理問題？
是的，孩子們的名字是什麼？是的，我不會告訴你，因為他們會非常生氣，但我會告訴你，我的孩子們沒有因為他們的名字而被嘲笑。他們因為很多其他事情被嘲笑，但不是他們的名字。你看到轉述如何真正幫助你更專心地傾聽了嗎？所以我要請你們做的是，找一個坐在你們周圍的另一個夥伴，自我介紹，然後你們夥伴關係中，為了這次活動，從最遠的地方來到校園的人（不是今天早上，如果你不是當地人，你住在附近的酒店，而是你來自哪裡），誰旅行最遠，誰就先開始。你們將講一個30秒關於你們名字的故事，你們的夥伴會立即轉述並問一個問題，你們不需要回答，然後你們會交換。這應該會花我們兩分鐘。找一個夥伴，講一個關於你們名字的故事。
被轉述你的故事感覺如何？感覺很好，不是嗎？被轉述你的故事感覺很好。
被傾聽感覺很好。現在我們不在這個房間裡，所以我們沒有像Zoom、Teams和Meet這些工具上的一些很酷的功能，所以我們將以老式的方式來做。大家把拳頭伸出來，像這樣。這是「是」，豎起大拇指是「是」，大拇指向下是「否」，沒有中指。你的夥伴轉述你的名字故事轉述得好嗎？我幾乎只看到豎起大拇指。我看到一個橫著的，我們可能有一個大拇指向下的，但每個班級總有一個。
不，傾聽轉述感覺如何？做這個感覺如何？很難，對吧？我看到豎起大拇指，但很難，對吧？你必須以不同的方式傾聽。當我看到你們所有人這樣做時，你們都向前傾，你們都在點頭，很明顯你們都在專心致志地傾聽。我們有能力好好傾聽，但我們必須鼓勵自己這樣做。當我們即興說話時，好好傾聽至關重要。所以我們現在已經完成了流程的前四個步驟：管理焦慮、擺脫自己的阻礙、將其視為機會、好好傾聽。所有這些都與心態有關。我們還沒有在當下做出回應，所以那是下一部分，也就是訊息傳遞。訊息傳遞有兩個組成部分。首先，它與結構有關。結構至關重要。你如何組織你的訊息很重要。我們大多數人在被突然提問時只是胡言亂語，給出一堆資訊，而你的大腦不適合列表。我們很難記住只是胡言亂語的內容。我們的大腦實際上是為結構、為故事而設計的。對我來說，一個故事、一個結構不過是思想的邏輯連結，它有一個開頭、一個中間和一個結尾。我是在很多年前在史丹佛大學讀大學時學到了故事的力量和結構的力量。直到今天，我仍然可以一邊說話一邊倒著走直線。他們當時訓練了我們12週。他們教給我們最重要的事情是，他們說，作為這個校園裡一個好的導遊，你最重要的是永遠不要讓你的旅行團迷路。如果你讓別人迷路，你就是一個糟糕的導遊。我們作為即興演講者也是如此，永遠不要讓你的聽眾迷失。我們如何讓大家保持在一起？我們組織我們的回應。結構幫助我們引導人們並設定期望。如果我出現並說：「嗨，我是Matt，我是你們的導遊，我們走吧！」你們中有多少人會跟我走？少數人，因為你們喜歡冒險，但你們其他人會說：「才不呢！我們要去哪裡？我穿對鞋子了嗎？我應該先去洗手間嗎？」一個好的導遊，就像一個好的即興演講者一樣，會預先設定期望，這樣你就可以專注於正在發生的事情，而不用擔心接下來會發生什麼。結構還有助於將思想連結在一起。作為導遊，你最容易讓大家迷失的地方，或者說最常讓大家迷失的地方，是當你從一個地方移動到另一個地方時，人們就會走散。在我們的溝通中也是如此。如果你使用「所以」、「接下來」、「第二」、「第三」這樣的詞作為過渡，那麼你就錯失了讓大家保持在一起的機會。所以結構真的很重要。讓我給你們一個結構的例子，這樣你們就能理解它。我們大多數人都熟悉一個非常有說服力的結構：「問題-解決方案-好處」。如果你曾經推銷過一個想法，如果你曾經看過廣告，它們都是這樣做的：「問題-解決方案-好處」。這是一個問題，這是我們如何解決它，這是好處。這是一個結構，有開頭、中間和結尾。現在我最喜歡的結構是三個簡單的問題：「什麼？」「所以呢？」「然後呢？」。「什麼」是你的想法、你的信念、你的立場、你的產品、你的服務、你的回饋。「所以呢」是為什麼它對你說話的人很重要。然後「然後呢」是接下來會發生什麼？也許我會回答你的問題，我們再開一次會，讓我給你演示一下。
「什麼？所以呢？然後呢？」是一種很好的打包資訊的方式。當你這個週末和朋友見面，有人問你：「你最近在忙什麼？」這是一個很好的更新結構：「這是我正在做的事情，這是我認為它很重要的原因，這是我接下來打算做的事情。」當你給予回饋時，你可以用這個結構給予回饋。回饋是「我看到了什麼」或「我沒看到什麼」，「所以呢」是為什麼它很重要，而「然後呢」是「我希望你下次做什麼不同」。所以想像一下，我們一起走出會議，你說：「Matt，進展如何？」我說：「嗯，我認為進展得很好，除了當你談到實施計劃時，你說得很快，而且沒有像其他地方那樣給出那麼多細節。當你說得很快，沒有太多細節時，人們可能會認為你很緊張，而且沒有準備好。下次請放慢速度，並使用這兩個額外的例子。」你看到嗎？在當下，只要遵循這個結構，它就能給我一個很好的回應。結構是一個工具，它就像一個食譜。我是一個糟糕的廚師，但如果我遵循食譜，我做飯成功的機會就會大得多。所以有了食譜，我所要做的就是把食材放進去。我知道我會如何給你回饋，我只需要思考我在回饋中說什麼。所以結構不僅幫助你為你的聽眾打包資訊，它還幫助你優先考慮要說什麼，而且因為資訊包裝得很好，你的聽眾可以將這些資訊帶到其他地方分享。想想面試時，當你被面試時，你不僅要傳達你的技能以及你如何能為公司帶來好處，你還要讓面試官掌握資訊，讓他們可以將這些資訊帶給參與招聘決策的其他人，並代表你。如果你輕鬆地打包這些資訊，他們就能很好地講述你的故事。如果你只是給他們一堆資訊，他們很可能記不住。所以結構在即興溝通中非常有幫助。在新書中，後半部分都是關於特定的即興情境：閒聊、道歉、給予回饋、自我介紹、回答問題，對於每一個情境，我都指定或給出一個你可以使用的結構。
這還不是最後一步，最後一步是溝通的「F詞」，它不是你們中有些人正在想的那個不雅的詞，它是「專注」（Focus）。我們許多人在當下說話時，會帶著聽眾一起探索我們想說什麼的過程，換句話說，我們說得比需要說的更多。我們需要專注和簡潔。我媽媽有一句我喜歡的話，我知道她不是原創者，但它是：「告訴我時間，不要為我造鐘。」我們許多人在即興說話時都在造鐘，原因有三：一，我們正在探索我們想說什麼；二，我們想讓別人認為我們很聰明；三，我們想讓每個人都看到我們為了說出這些話付出了多少努力。說話簡潔明瞭會好得多。那麼你如何做到這一點呢？嗯，首先，我們已經談過相關性。如果我思考對聽眾真正相關的是什麼，那麼我所說的一切都圍繞著這個相關性。
其次，你應該有一個目標，無論是即興還是有計劃的演講，對我來說，一個目標有三個部分：資訊、情感和行動。我希望聽眾知道什麼？我希望他們感覺如何？我希望他們做什麼？所以如果我走進一個房間，我預計會被問問題，或者被要求給予回饋，甚至只是閒聊，我會想：「我希望人們知道什麼？我希望他們感覺如何？我希望他們做什麼？」這有助於我專注並優先考慮我所說的內容。
所以僅僅有一個結構化的訊息是不夠的，你必須專注於那個訊息，以幫助人們記住它，並且不被視為胡言亂語和給予過多的資訊。我想向你們介紹另一個結構，它非常專注和簡潔。這是一個推銷的結構。人們經常問我，如果有人在當下要求我推銷一個想法，該怎麼辦？所以你正在搭電梯，你的老闆的老闆走進來，他們看著你說：「哦，你正在忙什麼？我正要去和董事會談話，也許我可以幫助你。」你必須回應四個句子開頭，你只需完成這些句子：「如果可以……，這樣……，例如……，而且這還不是全部……」。「如果可以……，這樣……，例如……，而且這還不是全部……」讓我向你們展示這是如何運作的，我會從你們所有人那裡得到一個建議，我會把它放進這個結構中，然後我們將一起用它來做一些事情。有人能想到一個你們想聽我推銷的產品或服務嗎？你們想聽我推銷什麼？你的書。我的書？嗯，看看這個。嗯，對，我很感謝。所以我的新書都是關於如何在當下更有效地說話。如果可以讓你感到更自在和自信，當你被突然提問時，這樣你就可以很好地回答問題或給予適當的回饋。例如，想像一下即將到來的面試，你表現出色，你以一種真正代表你自己的方式表達了所有觀點。而且這還不是全部，你可以將這些原則應用於閒聊、道歉，甚至自我介紹。你看到嗎？只要回答這些句子，你就能得到一個緊湊、清晰的推銷。所以這就是我們要做的，讓你們所有人練習，謝謝你們給我這個機會。
好的，我們都在這裡參加史丹佛校友會。讓我們想像一下，為了你們的下一次校友會，你們自願幫助招募人們回到校園參加校友會。所以你們將進行一次推銷。讓我們一起完成這四個部分。有人能給我這個句子的結尾嗎：「如果可以……」
如果可以見到老朋友，這樣你就可以回憶過去，並體驗你在校園裡喜歡的事情。例如，有人能給我一個你想要與老朋友分享的回憶或令人興奮的事情的例子嗎？例如，聽樂隊演奏並唱一些老歌。而且這還不是全部。
而且這還不是全部，你
你可以去聽一場關於即時溝通的精彩講座。我喜歡！你看到這有多容易嗎？你看到結構如何幫助你，並使其非常簡潔嗎？所以通過專注於這兩個訊息傳遞元素：結構和專注，你實際上可以更好地在當下說話。
所以這裡有一些資源供你們繼續學習這些概念和其他內容。我為商學院主持一個播客，叫做「更快思考，更聰明說話」，它都是關於溝通技巧的。我會採訪來自校園和世界各地的專家，討論如何成為一個更好的溝通者。你們許多喜歡的教職員都曾是節目的嘉賓，我很自豪地說，這個節目贏得了許多享有盛譽的獎項，包括最佳遛狗播客和最佳通勤播客，因為我們的節目非常簡潔，只有20分鐘。我們也贏得了其他一些獎項。這有一張書的圖片：《更快思考，更聰明說話》。如果你掃描這個QR碼，它會帶你到我為這裡和其他地方的學生提供的許多資源。我鼓勵你們所有人思考如何成為一個更好的即時演講者。這需要時間和練習。你唯一能提高溝通能力（無論是有計劃的還是即興的）的方法是三件事：重複、反思和回饋。重複、反思和回饋。
你必須練習，你必須思考什麼有效，什麼無效，你必須向老師、同事、導師尋求建議和指導，以幫助你。這就是我們變得更好的方式。

**user**: 整理結構化內容
[Context: Notes: 需翻譯_去時間軸/Think Faster, Talk Smarter with Matt Abrahams-en.md]
[Timestamp: 2025/11/16 16:41:44]

**ai**: 好的，這份筆記的結構化內容整理如下：

## 提升即時溝通能力：Matt Abrahams 的六步驟方法

### 引言
*   **問題：** 自我介紹、閒聊和即時說話常令人感到挑戰、尷尬和不適。
*   **目標：** 在當下更快思考、更聰明地說話。
*   **背景：** 此方法由Matt Abrahams為史丹佛MBA學生開發，旨在幫助他們應對突發提問和各種溝通情境。

### 六步驟方法
分為兩大類：心態 (Mindset) 和訊息傳遞 (Messaging)。

#### 一、心態 (Mindset)

1.  **管理焦慮 (Managing Anxiety)**
    *   **普遍性：** 超過85%的人在高風險情境下會緊張，緊張的演講者會讓聽眾感到「二手焦慮」。
    *   **雙管齊下：** 管理生理症狀和焦慮來源。
        *   **生理症狀：**
            *   常見表現：臉紅、出汗、口乾舌燥、腦袋空白、心跳加速、發抖。
            *   身體反應：將即時說話視為威脅，啟動「戰鬥或逃跑」反應。
            *   **應對技巧：**
                *   深腹式呼吸：呼氣時間是吸氣的兩倍。
                *   口乾：喝溫水、含喉糖、嚼口香糖。
                *   臉紅/出汗：手心握冰冷物。
        *   **焦慮來源：**
            *   目標導向的緊張：擔心無法達成目標，對潛在負面結果的擔憂。
            *   **應對技巧 (專注於當下)：**
                *   進行身體活動：例如面試前散步。
                *   聽音樂。
                *   與人交談。
                *   從100倒數17。
                *   說繞口令 (作為熱身)。

2.  **最大化平庸 (Maximizing Mediocrity)**
    *   **自我阻礙：** 過度評判和評估自己的言論會降低認知頻寬。
    *   **核心理念：** 允許自己「只是」回答問題、給予回饋或閒聊，反而能做得更好。
    *   **目標：** 先允許平庸，才能成就卓越。

3.  **將說話視為機會而非威脅 (Seeing Speaking as an Opportunity, Not a Threat)**
    *   **常見誤區：** 許多人將即時溝通視為威脅和挑戰，導致退縮、回答簡短、語氣生硬。
    *   **「送禮」活動：** 透過即興遊戲體驗將溝通視為機會。
    *   **轉化思維的工具：**
        *   **成長型思維 (Growth Mindset)：** 挑戰是學習和成長的機會，抱持「還沒」的心態。
        *   **「是的，而且……」 (Yes, and)：** 擁抱可能性，即使有分歧也要尋找共同點。
        *   **「下一回合」 (Next Play)：** 借鑒籃球概念，不要沉溺於當下的錯誤，繼續前進。
        *   **事後反思 (Reflection)：** 在溝通後反思哪些有效、哪些無效。
        *   **「錯失的鏡頭」 (Missed Takes)：** 將錯誤重新定義為「鏡頭」（如電影拍攝），不是錯，只是優化嘗試。

4.  **傾聽 (Listening)**
    *   **普遍問題：** 大多數人不擅長深入傾聽，只聽取要點後便開始準備回應。
    *   **重要性：** 深入傾聽對於理解當下真正需求至關重要。
    *   **提升傾聽的建議：**
        *   **專心致志地傾聽：** 傾聽直到「出汗」，專注於核心要點。
        *   **步調、空間、優雅 (Pace, Space, Grace)：**
            *   **步調：** 放慢速度。
            *   **空間：** 給予自己物理和心理空間，專注於當下。
            *   **優雅：** 注意對方說話的方式，並傾聽自己的直覺。
        *   **實用工具：**
            *   停頓。
            *   提出澄清問題。
            *   轉述 (綜合提煉，而非鸚鵡學舌)。
            *   這些是較低階的認知技能，有助於預先思考。

#### 二、訊息傳遞 (Messaging)

5.  **結構 (Structure)**
    *   **關鍵性：** 結構對於訊息清晰度至關重要，大腦更傾向於結構和故事，而非列表。
    *   **作用：** 幫助引導聽眾、設定期望、連結思想（避免使用「所以」、「接下來」等簡單過渡詞）。
    *   **範例結構：**
        *   **問題-解決方案-好處 (Problem-Solution-Benefit)**
        *   **什麼？所以呢？然後呢？ (What? So What? Now What?)**
            *   **什麼 (What)：** 你的想法、信念、立場、產品、服務、回饋。
            *   **所以呢 (So What)：** 對聽眾而言為何重要。
            *   **然後呢 (Now What)：** 接下來的行動（例如：回答問題、安排下次會議、演示）。
    *   **效益：** 結構有助於打包資訊、優先排序，並讓聽眾更容易分享你的故事。

6.  **專注 (Focus)**
    *   **避免冗長：** 保持簡潔，避免「為我造鐘，而非告訴我時間」。
    *   **冗長原因：** 探索想說的內容、想顯得聰明、想展示努力。
    *   **如何專注：**
        *   **相關性 (Relevance)：** 將所有內容圍繞對聽眾而言最相關的點。
        *   **目標 (Goal)：** 包含三個部分：
            *   **資訊：** 希望聽眾知道什麼？
            *   **情感：** 希望聽眾感覺如何？
            *   **行動：** 希望聽眾做什麼？
    *   **推銷結構 (Pitching Structure)：** 四個句子開頭：
        *   「如果可以……」 (What if you could...)
        *   「……這樣……」 (...so that...)
        *   「……例如……」 (...for example...)
        *   「……而且這還不是全部……」 (...and that's not all...)

### 結論
*   **資源：** 播客「更快思考，更聰明說話」(Think Fast, Talk Smart)、書籍《更快思考，更聰明說話》(Think Faster, Talk Smarter)。
*   **提升溝通能力的關鍵：** 重複 (Repetition)、反思 (Reflection) 和回饋 (Feedback)。
