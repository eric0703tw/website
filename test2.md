**ai**: 好的，這是去除時間軸後的內容：

The most productive people in the world,
they don't rely on discipline and brute
force to stay focused. They found hacks
to trick their brain into this
superhuman level of productivity. So,
I'm going to share with you 10 hacks
that will make you more focused, even if
you have crippling ADHD like I do. These
are the strategies that I use to go from
an ADHD mess to a hyperfocused CEO. You
can start using these today to stop
fighting against your brain and start
using it as a superpower. So, with that
being said, these are the 10 hacks to
unlock insane focus. Starting with hack
number one, make a notto-do list. Here's
my philosophy. Focus is a filter, not a
muscle. Stop trying to brute force
yourself into focus. Decide what you
don't want to do so that you can make
decisions quicker. If every new decision
comes into your life and you have to sit
there with the mental overload and brain
powder, try to make a good decision
because you haven't set up a filter,
it's going to drain your energy. To me,
a new yes is a no to your dream. And a
no is a yes to your goals. If you think
about the most successful people, you
see that success is a subtractive
process, not an additive process. You
don't do more to win, you do less, but
you make the things you say no to the
right yeses. So, when people ask me
like, "Hey Dan, what did you do to be
successful to drive those cars or fly
around on your plane?" Uh, it's what I
don't do. I don't drink. I don't gamble.
I don't play video games. I don't vape.
I don't do a bunch of stuff that would
impede me from winning. And it requires
that to have the level of focus we're
talking about. The way I think about it,
you know that game Plinko where you have
like these balls you drop at the top and
it hits all these different pins and it
goes all over the place. That's how most
people live their life. What I want you
to do is break out all the other options
which is those pins. Drop the ball. Go
straight to the middle. If you think
about each one of those as being a
energy unit of focus, then you would
just literally focus and stack and focus
and stack instead of spreading yourself
thin across so many different options.
So what goes on the notto-do list for
me? Number one is lowv value task.
Anything that I can pay anybody else to
do for a little bit amount of money or
just use an app to get brought to me or
get done, I'm not doing it. Number two
is bad habit and vices. Some of you guys
have bad habits of not confronting
people that say about you. Some of you
have vices like you literally lay in bed
and hit the snooze button 15 times
before you get out of bed. Those things
have to go. The third is energy
vampires. When I'm interacting with
somebody, they either give me energy or
they take my energy. The people that
take my energy see you. Which brings us
to hack number two. Create focus
triggers. Most people wait for
inspiration to do work or hope they'll
magically get in the zone randomly to
start doing the work. I create a
structure to get myself into flow so
that it is by design, not random. See,
flow state isn't random. It's designed.
And when you're in it, guess what? I
don't think about going to the bathroom.
I don't worry about what other people
think of me. I don't worry if my work's
very good. When I'm in flow state, it
produces the best work possible. The way
I quickly get into flow is I create
focus triggers. So, for example, the
location, the chair that I sit in to do
my reading, to outline my goals, to
ideulate. I mean, even when I go off
sites with my wife to plan our quarterly
planning, our year in planning, those
are triggers for us to focus on
designing our future, not worry about
what happened this week or next week or
anything like that. The second is sound.
When I need to focus, I have to have
music playing. It's a vibe. It's a
strategy. Deep work, I'll sometimes put
on playlists that have no words, or I'll
use a special app that uses binaural
beats to actually improve my ability to
focus. Headphones are a must cuz I can't
be distracted with other people's noise.
And the last one is routines. When you
look at worldclass athletes and you
think about how they visualize, how they
warm up, the way they structure their
day, their week, their month, it is a
rhythm. It is a rhythm of success and it
is a routine. And a lot of people think,
well, that would be boring. You know
what's not boring? Having the resources
to do what you want, when you want, with
who you want. And if that requires some
level of routine, sign me up. Which
brings us to hack number three. Start on
hard mode. This one is wild is that a
lot of people try to start easy. Let's
make it easy. Let's build momentum. How
about stop trying to create momentum
with easy wins. I think if you want to
focus and get things done, attack it.
Like go all in. Like literally start on
hard mode. Make it hard. If you do
everything that's easy, it's kind of
like starting your meal with dessert.
Sure, you might enjoy it and it might
fill you up, but it's not going to give
you the nutritions you need to actually
build your body and you'll be too full
to eat the real food. So, to me, we
start with the thing that's the hardest,
not the easiest to do. In many ways, the
hardest task is to stop picking the
easiest task. So, to dial this in and
really get your focus, we have to do a
few things. First off, we have to choose
the one thing. What's the one thing? For
most business owners, it's marketing.
For most individuals, it's working out.
But what's the one thing that if you do
first as soon as you wake up or you sit
down at your desk that it will set you
up to win that it will build that
confidence to create momentum that will
give you the vibe of success. That one
thing if you just nail it out of the
park every time. It's kind of like that
first domino that you know if you get
that right the rest of the dominoes will
fall down. That's where we start. Then
what we do is we do deep work blocks.
For me, it's first thing in the morning.
I used to be a late night guy, and you
can do that, too. But as soon as I had
human alarm clocks, aka kids, my
mornings became my most precious time
because that's when I create connected
to my creator. When I think of like
writing, outlining these videos,
creating videos, coming up with new AI
companies to start, strategy work. It
has to happen first thing in the morning
in my deep work blocks. And it all
happens before checking my email, social
media, or anything else. I can't tell
you how my energy is affected by the
things I consume and if I accidentally
go down a rabbit hole and see stuff or
check things and all of a sudden ah I
have this like oh crap feeling and now
I'm supposed to go dream ideate design
something cool but I'm in this headsp
space of like no you know what I mean my
day is going from bad meeting to bad
meeting I love the people I work with
but nobody brings me anything other than
problems to try to resolve so I can't
check my email before I do the right
work You can't be like reading comments
on your social media feed about what
people think of you before you go sit
down and create more videos to help
people cuz you're going to be like, "Oh,
screw that person. I'm not even doing
this video anymore." See the challenge
with that? Which brings us to hack
number four. Be hard to reach. When I
was sitting down and editing my book,
Buy Back Your Time, I had my buddy Chris
and we got in my car and we drove to the
mountains. There was no internet. There
was no connectivity. And we stayed in a
cabin and we got our laptops out and we
edited literally for 16 hours a day. We
did it for 5 days. We had a rhythm of
working out, editing, lunch, editing,
dinner, editing, pass out. The reason
we're able to do that is cuz we are
disconnected from distractions. See,
some of you make it too easy to be
interrupted. The notifications are going
off, the phone's going off, your inbox
is like blowing up. I mean, your inbox
is nothing more than a public to-do list
of other people's priorities on your
time. My philosophy is you want to be
easy to find all over the internet, but
hard to reach. The only way to make that
work is to use these strategies. The
first is turn off all your
notifications. I mean, go into the app
under notifications and I dare you to
swipe them off. The only two people in
my life that can get through to me is my
wife and my assistant. Other than that,
everybody else can wait. Second thing is
a schedule time to respond. See, I do
reply to people, text messages, etc. I
have it in my calendar, so it's
dedicated. That way, it's a forcing
function. If I got 60 minutes, I'm
spending that 60 minutes heads down. I
was standing in the hot tub behind me
earlier replying to all my text
messages. So, call that net time. No
extra time. Post-workout hot tub sitting
there text messaging creating momentum
in my life. Figure out how to put both
of those together. The third is use
focus signals. So, for me, I have my
headphones on. Please don't talk to me.
Unless it's an emergency. I do have a
rule that if you come in my office and
I'm on a call, you then have to present
on your call. So, my kids have been on
board meetings. They've been on pitch
meetings. They literally if you're in
the room and you're asking me a
question, I'm not going to introduce you
to the people I'm talking to. My kids
are my priority. But they know if the
doors close and unless it's an
emergency, they don't come in. It is so
hard for me to focus to get in the zone
that when I'm in it, I got to protect
myself. And the fourth one is just
remove yourself. I have team members
that choose on certain days I don't want
to come to work cuz I'm going to sit at
home. No distractions, no conversations,
no taps on the shoulders, no got a
seconds, no nothing. just boom, get it
done. Other people, they go to coffee
shops. Here's an advanced move. Don't
take your power cable with you. That
way, when you're there and you know your
battery is slowly dying, slowly down,
slowly down. It'll force you to get that
work done. But coffee shops are great.
Other offices are great. You can
literally go to your buddy's office and
say, "Hey man, can I hang out in your
conference room?" Which brings us to
hack number five. Turn up the pressure.
So imagine this. You've got to move out
of your place, but you got 3 months to
move out. Think about how you would
approach that. You would probably take
your time, walk around slowly, get
distracted easily, pack sometimes. You
wouldn't move with a sense of purpose.
But if I told you you had 3 days to get
out of your place or lose all your
stuff, you wouldn't waste a minute.
That's what it means to turn up the
pressure. There's two ways that you can
do this to yourself before the world
does it to you. The first is to shorten
the timeline. You see, there's this
thing called Parkinson's law that states
the work will expand to the available
time given to it. Which means if you
give yourself a lot of time, you'll take
a lot of time. When I'm talking to
people on my team and they're like,
"Yeah, I'll get that to you at the end
of the day or the end of the week or the
end of the month," I'm like, "No, no,
no. Why not 3 PM? Why not Wednesday? Why
not the 10th of the month?" Most people
default to just giving themselves
arbitrary timelines that don't force the
creativity and the focus to get more
done. The second is to increase the
stakes. What happens if you don't? See,
then you don't have an out. There's this
woman on my team, Jen, who wanted to
lose weight. She was sick of it. She
told the whole team. She asked me for my
help. I said, "Do you want the real
stake?" She said, "Yes." I said, "Cool.
This is how it works. If you don't hit
your goal by a certain date, you can't
stay on the team." You hit that goal by
then, I cannot go on that. If you don't
hit your goal, you can't stay on the
team. Shake my hand. Hold on. No. Make
it a non-negotiable.
And she went, "Oh, no. Well, that's what
I'm saying is like, I care about you. I
want to see you win. You ask me for my
help." That's real stakes. See, most
people don't have any downside if they
don't do. And because of that, they
don't do. Which brings us to hack number
six. Train your algorithm. What I find
fascinating is the billion-dollar tech
companies. These giants hire the world's
best psychologists to design software
with one purpose, and it's to distract
you, to get you to come back in the app.
I'm talking they run split tests on the
red for the notification jewel. They'll
run AB tests on the message of the
notification they send to your phone.
All to get you back and distract you.
However, you can fight against it. See,
I actually use my social media feed to
feed my brain. And this is how I do it.
First off, I teach it my preferences. I
search for things I want to learn about.
I leave a comment on the videos that I
find interesting. And that tells the
algorithm I'm engaged. Second is I
unfollow any account or mute friends
that are not contributing to the areas I
want to learn or get better at and I'm
unapologetic about it because my feed
works for me. I don't work for it. And
the third is integrate what I learn. So
there's one thing to learn something,
see something, save thing. I'm saying
share it and more importantly teach it.
When you teach other people, you will
learn completely different. Which brings
us to hack number seven. Design your
perfect week. This one is going to
shatter some of your beliefs. But
multitasking doesn't work. It's crazy,
but it takes 23 minutes on average to
refocus after your distraction. So when
you're doing work, you got to fight for
that focus. The funny way I like to
think about it is multitasking. It just
means screwing up multiple things at
once. So this is what I suggest to
create your perfect week. The first area
is start with the big rocks. These are
the non-negotiables. These are the
things that you know that if you get
done, everything else will be good. This
is the date nights, the workouts, the
reading time, the strategy meetings, the
weekly rhythms with your teams, the best
practices for the best life. The second
area is understanding that theming your
days for different things like
marketing, sales, strategy, one-on- ons
will help you understand where to put
things in your life on what days so it's
not a decision every time. The third
area is batch and block tasks together.
That ability to take your content
creation or all your conversations and
batch them together and block it in your
calendar into 30 or 45 minute meetings
is a game changer. And the most
important is plan around your energy,
not just your time. I know there's
certain types of tasks I do in the
morning that fuels me to the next level
of task that fuels me to the afternoon,
that fuels me to the nighttime with my
family, and if I did them out of
sequence, I wouldn't be good for
anybody. I wasn't going to do this, but
it would be probably pretty of me not to
do it. Essentially, if you want my
perfect week template, what I use to
structure my week every day, just find
me on Instagram, message me the word
perfect, and I'll send you the direct
link to the dock. No opt-in, no email,
my gift to you. Which brings us to hack
number eight. Gify your work. The reason
why video games are so addictive is
because they have levels and you
visually see your progress when you're
playing them. And what I've learned in
life, new levels, new devils, and it'll
make you want to progress when you
understand you're getting better. So,
design your life where you can measure
the wins. You don't get distracted
because you're bored. You get distracted
because you can't see your progress.
Progress is happiness. Anybody that's
struggling in life right now, I know
that if they made a little bit of
progress in their life, they would just
feel better. So, let's gify our work so
that we show up with focus and
attention. Number one, we got to track
our streaks. Jelly Roll came out with
this great song about winning streaks.
And I just love that philosophy that if
you measure yourself doing something and
you can go day after day after day and
just make it a simple win that day, if
it's 10 sales calls a day, how many days
can you go in a row? My buddy Ben has
been working out. I think he said the
other day 1,200 days in a row he's
worked out and he's done his unrequired
workout. That's wild. The second is you
got to create milestones for the
rewards. This is my favorite cuz I like
to buy things and go on trips. I like to
use milestones as a marker for rewarding
myself like vacations with my family or
my friends as a way to have something to
build towards. The third is make it
visual. I'm a fan of technology, but I
will tell you when you have that in
front of your face as a poster on your
backdrop on your computer, put it on
your whiteboard, I don't care where it
is, but get it outside of your brain and
put it out in front of you so you can
see it every time. That makes it fun.
The fourth is do it together. The more
people you can enroll into the process
of winning, you will create focus around
your outcome like you've never felt.
Because the truth is is you'll do more
for other people, especially if you're
the person that got them to start that
competition or that weight loss thing,
than you will do for yourself. So having
that group of people to do it together
with is a pro move. Which brings us to
hack number nine. Manage your energy.
Exhaust the body, tame the mind. If you
follow me on Instagram, and if you
don't, you should because I'm a good
time, you will see me post almost daily,
exhaust the body, tame the mind. For me,
my energy is a byproduct of my habits.
And if I've got things going on in my
mind and I need to focus, I got to first
exhaust my body. My morning routine is
where I create my proactive energy
boost. The first thing I do is focus on
my process for how I wake up, what I've
decided to do. It's in my calendar. I
move my body. I read my books. I ramp up
my focus so that I can get my best work
done. I'm all about energy and there's
two ways that I make sure that my day
gets the best of me. First off is a
proactive energy boost. That is how I
proactively start my day. This is my
morning routine. This is the philosophy
of prioritizing the pump, getting it on
the calendar, making sure my stuff's
prepped. If I got to work out, I put
that stuff out the night before so when
I wake up, it's ready to go. I don't
have to have decision fatigue. The other
one is reactive energy boost. This is
when I feel drained. Maybe my eyeballs
hurt. I don't know why sometimes that
happens. And I just got to reset. I
mean, the other day I was giving a talk
and a guy asked me, he's like, "Hey man,
how do you deal with like feeling
lethargic and tired and like you've got
the weight of the world on you?" And I'm
like, "Dude, get up front, do some
push-ups." And I did the push-ups with
him. And we sat there and I said, "Keep
going, keep going, keep going until he
failed." And when he failed, I said, "On
your knees." And he went on his knees.
And then we were all done. I said, "Now,
how do you feel?" He's like, "9 out of
10." I said, "That took 46 seconds."
Most people don't realize they can reset
their energy cuz you don't have energy.
You create energy. I can prove it. If I
told you you had $10 million cash in the
bank, taxes paid. How would you feel
that feeling? Where'd that come from? Up
here. The other thing I love to do is
walking meetings or scooter meetings.
All my one-on- ones are done on a
scooter. Why? A lot more fun. Which
brings us to hack number 10. Find your
flow. You see, I grew up thinking I was
broken. I was told I was broken. Needed
medication. Put on rolin when I was 11.
And what I've realized, it wasn't that
my mind was broken, is that I just
needed to find a different way to work
that worked for me. So, here's what I
know. Your journey will be very unique.
Nobody else can tell you how to do it. I
can give you some thoughts, but you got
to figure it out for you. Take the time
to reflect. Journal what you're thinking
about, what's working, what's not. When
I did this, I felt really good. And then
constantly tweak. That's what I do. I
look at my calendar because it's
designed. I said, "That felt good." And
some things used to give me energy that
was very productive and all of a sudden
now based on where I'm at in life, it
doesn't work for me anymore. And you're
allowed to iterate. You're allowed to
take stuff out and try new things on
like new clothes. Does it fit well? If
it doesn't, take it off. Go find
something different. The big idea though
is don't give up. Don't give up on you.
I know that if you master the ability to
find your energy, your focus, and your
flow, your dreams exist on the other
side of that. Now, if you want to learn
the eight habits that will fix 98% of
your problems, click here and I'll see

**ai**: 好的，這是翻譯成繁體中文的內容：

世界上最有效率的人，
他們不依賴紀律和蠻力來保持專注。他們找到了技巧，
來欺騙他們的大腦進入這種
超人般的生產力水平。所以，
我將與你分享10個技巧，
即使你像我一樣患有嚴重的注意力不足過動症，這些技巧也能讓你更專注。這些
是我用來從
一個注意力不足過動症的混亂狀態，轉變為一個高度專注的執行長的策略。你
今天就可以開始使用這些方法，停止
與你的大腦對抗，開始
將它作為一種超能力來使用。所以，話雖如此，
這10個技巧可以
解鎖驚人的專注力。從技巧
一開始，列出一個「不去做」清單。這是
我的哲學。專注是一種過濾器，而不是
肌肉。停止試圖強迫自己
專注。決定你
不想做什麼，這樣你就能更快地做出決定。如果每一個新決定
進入你的生活，你都必須坐在那裡，面對精神超載和腦力
耗盡，試圖做出一個好的決定，
因為你沒有設定過濾器，
這會耗盡你的精力。對我來說，
一個新的「是」就是對你夢想的「不」。而一個
「不」就是對你目標的「是」。如果你想想
最成功的人，你
會發現成功是一個減法
過程，而不是加法過程。你
不是做更多來贏，你做更少，但是
你把你說「不」的事情變成
正確的「是」。所以，當人們問我
「嘿，丹，你做了什麼才能成功，才能開那些車，或者坐
你的飛機到處飛？」嗯，這是我
不做的事情。我不喝酒。我不賭博。
我不玩電動遊戲。我不抽電子煙。
我不會做很多會
阻礙我獲勝的事情。而這需要
達到我們所說的專注水平。我這樣想，
你知道那個Plinko遊戲嗎？你把
球從頂部放下去，它會撞到所有這些不同的釘子，然後
到處亂跑。大多數人就是這樣過生活的。我希望你
做的是排除所有其他選項，
也就是那些釘子。放下球。直接
到中間。如果你把每一個選項都看作是一個
專注的能量單位，那麼你就會
只是單純地專注和累積，專注
和累積，而不是將自己
分散在這麼多不同的選項上。
那麼，我的「不去做」清單上有什麼呢？第一是低價值任務。
任何我可以用一點錢請別人做，或者
只是用一個應用程式就能完成的事情，
我都不會做。第二是壞習慣和惡習。你們有些人
有不面對
那些說你壞話的人的壞習慣。你們有些人
有惡習，比如你真的躺在床上
按了15次貪睡按鈕才起床。這些事情
都必須戒掉。第三是能量
吸血鬼。當我與
某人互動時，他們要嘛給我能量，要嘛
吸取我的能量。那些
吸取我能量的人，再見。這就引導我們
到技巧二。創造專注
觸發器。大多數人等待
靈感來工作，或者希望他們能
奇蹟般地隨機進入狀態，開始
工作。我創造了一個
結構來讓自己進入心流狀態，
這樣它是設計好的，而不是隨機的。看，
心流狀態不是隨機的。它是設計好的。
當你處於其中時，你猜怎麼著？我
不會想上廁所。
我不會擔心別人
怎麼看我。我不會擔心我的工作是否
很好。當我處於心流狀態時，它
能產生最好的工作。我快速進入心流狀態的方法是
創造專注觸發器。所以，例如，
地點，我坐著閱讀的椅子，
規劃我的目標，
構思。我的意思是，即使我與妻子
外出規劃我們的季度
規劃，我們的年度規劃，那些
都是我們專注於
設計我們未來的觸發器，而不是擔心
這週或下週發生了什麼，或者
諸如此類的事情。第二是聲音。
當我需要專注時，我必須播放
音樂。這是一種氛圍。這是一種
策略。深度工作時，我會偶爾播放
沒有歌詞的播放列表，或者我會
使用一個特殊的應用程式，它使用雙耳
節拍來實際提高我的專注能力。
耳機是必須的，因為我不能被別人的噪音
分心。最後一個是例行公事。當你
看世界級運動員時，你
想想他們如何視覺化，如何
熱身，他們如何安排他們的
一天、一週、一個月，這是一種
節奏。這是一種成功的節奏，它
是一種例行公事。很多人會想，
嗯，那會很無聊。你知道
什麼不無聊嗎？擁有資源
隨心所欲地做你想做的事，與
你想見的人在一起。如果這需要某種
程度的例行公事，請算我一份。這就引導我們
到技巧三。從
困難模式開始。這一個很瘋狂，就是
很多人試圖從簡單開始。讓我們
讓它變簡單。讓我們建立動能。不如
停止試圖透過簡單的勝利
來創造動能。我認為如果你想
專注並完成事情，就去攻擊它。
就像全力以赴。就像真的從
困難模式開始。讓它變難。如果你做
所有簡單的事情，那就像是
用甜點開始你的正餐。
當然，你可能會喜歡它，它可能會
讓你飽足，但它不會給你
你實際建立身體所需的營養，
而且你會太飽而吃不下真正的食物。所以，對我來說，我們
從最困難的事情開始，
而不是最簡單的事情。在許多方面，最困難的任務是
停止選擇最簡單的任務。所以，為了深入探討這一點，
並真正獲得專注，我們必須做
幾件事。首先，我們必須選擇
一件事。什麼是那件事？對於
大多數企業主來說，是行銷。
對於大多數個人來說，是運動。
但是，如果你在醒來後或
坐到辦公桌前，首先做那件事，
它會讓你贏，它會建立
信心來創造動能，它會
給你成功的氛圍。那件事，
如果你每次都能完美地完成它。這就像是
第一張骨牌，你知道如果你做對了，
其餘的骨牌就會
倒下。我們從那裡開始。然後
我們做的是深度工作區塊。
對我來說，是早上第一件事。
我以前是個夜貓子，你
也可以那樣做。但當我有了
人類鬧鐘，也就是孩子們之後，我的
早晨就成了我最寶貴的時間，
因為那是我與我的創造者連結
的時候。當我想到寫作、
這些影片的綱要、
製作影片、想出新的AI
公司來創辦、策略工作。它
必須在早上第一件事，在我的
深度工作區塊中完成。而且這一切
都發生在檢查我的電子郵件、社交
媒體或任何其他事情之前。我無法告訴你
我的精力是如何受到
我所消費的事物的影響的，如果我不小心
陷入一個兔子洞，看到一些東西，或者
檢查一些東西，然後突然間，啊，我
有這種「糟糕」的感覺，現在
我應該去夢想、構思、設計
一些很酷的東西，但我卻處於這種
「不」的思維空間，你知道我的意思嗎？我的
一天從糟糕的會議到糟糕的
會議。我愛我的同事，
但除了
問題之外，沒有人給我帶來任何東西，所以我無法
在做正確的工作之前檢查我的電子郵件。
你不能在去坐下來製作更多影片來幫助
人們之前，閱讀社交媒體上的評論，
因為你會想：「哦，
去他的那個人。我甚至不拍這個影片了。」看到挑戰
了嗎？這就引導我們到技巧
四。難以聯繫。當我
坐下來編輯我的書
《買回你的時間》時，我的朋友克里斯
和我開車去了
山區。那裡沒有網路。那裡
沒有連線。我們住在一間
小屋裡，拿出我們的筆記型電腦，
每天編輯16個小時。我們
這樣做了5天。我們有規律地
運動、編輯、午餐、編輯、
晚餐、編輯、昏倒。我們之所以能做到這一點，
是因為我們與干擾
斷開了連結。看，
你們有些人讓自己太容易被
打斷了。通知不斷響起，
電話不斷響起，你的收件箱
就像爆炸了一樣。我的意思是，你的收件箱
不過是別人優先事項的公開待辦事項清單，
佔用了你的時間。我的哲學是，你希望
在網路上很容易被找到，但
難以聯繫。要做到這一點，
唯一的方法就是使用這些策略。
首先是關閉所有你的
通知。我的意思是，進入應用程式
的通知設定，我敢你
把它們關掉。我生命中只有兩個人
能聯繫到我，就是我的
妻子和我的助理。除此之外，
其他人都可以等。第二件事是
安排時間回覆。看，我確實
回覆人們的簡訊等等。我
把它排在我的日曆上，所以它是
專用的。這樣，它就成了一個強制
功能。如果我有60分鐘，我會
專心致志地花那60分鐘。我
剛才在我身後的熱水浴缸裡
回覆我所有的簡訊。
所以，稱之為淨時間。沒有
額外時間。運動後坐在熱水浴缸裡
發簡訊，為我的生活創造動能。
想辦法把這兩者結合起來。第三是使用
專注信號。所以，對我來說，我戴著
耳機。請不要跟我說話。
除非是緊急情況。我確實有一個
規定，如果你進我的辦公室，而我正在
通話中，那麼你必須在你的
通話中發言。所以，我的孩子們參加過
董事會會議。他們參加過推銷
會議。他們真的，如果你在
房間裡問我一個
問題，我不會把你介紹給我在說話的人。
我的孩子是我的優先事項。但他們知道，如果
門關著，除非是
緊急情況，他們不會進來。我太難
專注，太難進入狀態了，
所以當我進入狀態時，我必須保護
自己。第四個就是
離開。我的團隊成員
選擇在某些日子不來上班，因為他們要待在
家裡。沒有干擾，沒有交談，
沒有拍肩膀，沒有「有空嗎？」
沒有任何東西。就是「砰」，完成它。
其他人則去咖啡館。這是一個進階技巧。不要
帶你的電源線。
這樣，當你在那裡，你知道你的
電池正在慢慢耗盡，慢慢耗盡，
慢慢耗盡。這會迫使你完成
工作。但咖啡館很棒。
其他辦公室也很棒。你真的可以
去你朋友的辦公室說：
「嘿，老兄，我可以在你的
會議室待一下嗎？」這就引導我們到
技巧五。增加壓力。
想像一下。你必須搬出你的住處，
但你有3個月的時間搬家。
想想你會怎麼做。你可能會
慢慢來，慢慢走動，
很容易分心，偶爾打包。你
不會帶著目的感去搬家。
但如果我告訴你，你必須在3天內
搬出你的住處，否則會失去所有你的
東西，你就不會浪費一分鐘。
這就是增加壓力的意思。有兩種方法
你可以對自己這樣做，在世界
對你這樣做之前。第一是縮短
時間線。你看，有一個
帕金森定律，它指出
工作會擴展到可用的
時間。這意味著如果你
給自己很多時間，你就會花很多時間。
當我與我的團隊成員交談時，他們說：
「是的，我會在今天結束前或這週結束前或
這個月底前給你。」我說：「不，不，
不。為什麼不是下午3點？為什麼不是週三？為什麼
不是這個月的10號？」大多數人
預設只是給自己
任意的時間線，這並不能迫使
創造力和專注力來完成更多
工作。第二是增加
賭注。如果你不這樣做會發生什麼？看，
那你就沒有退路了。我團隊裡有一個
女人，珍，她想
減肥。她受夠了。她
告訴了整個團隊。她向我尋求幫助。
我說：「你想要真正的
賭注嗎？」她說：「是的。」我說：「好。
這是它的運作方式。如果你在某個日期前沒有達到你的目標，
你就不能留在團隊裡。」你必須在那個日期前達到目標，
我不能再說了。如果你沒有
達到你的目標，你就不能留在
團隊裡。握手。等等。不。讓它成為
不可協商的。
她說：「哦，不。嗯，我的意思是，我關心你。我
想看到你贏。你向我尋求幫助。」
那是真正的賭注。看，大多數
人如果沒有做，就沒有任何壞處。
正因為如此，他們
沒有做。這就引導我們到技巧
六。訓練你的演算法。我發現
令人著迷的是那些價值數十億美元的科技
公司。這些巨頭僱用了世界上
最好的心理學家來設計軟體，
只有一個目的，那就是讓你分心，
讓你回到應用程式中。
我說的是他們對通知紅點進行A/B測試。他們會
對發送到你手機的通知訊息進行A/B測試。
所有這些都是為了讓你回來並讓你分心。
然而，你可以對抗它。看，
我實際上利用我的社交媒體動態來
滋養我的大腦。我是這樣做的。
首先，我教它我的偏好。我
搜尋我想學習的東西。
我對我感興趣的影片留言。
這告訴演算法我參與了。第二是，我
取消關注任何帳戶或靜音那些
對我想要學習或改進的領域沒有貢獻的
朋友，我對此毫不抱歉，因為我的動態
為我服務。我不是為它服務。
第三是整合我所學到的。所以
學習東西、看到東西、儲存東西是一回事。
我說的是分享它，更重要的是教導它。
當你教導別人時，你會
學到完全不同的東西。這就引導我們
到技巧七。設計你的
完美一週。這一個會
打破你的一些信念。但是
多工處理是行不通的。這很瘋狂，
但平均需要23分鐘才能在分心後
重新專注。所以當你
工作時，你必須為專注而戰。
我喜歡這樣想：多工處理
只是意味著同時搞砸多件事情。
所以這是我建議你
創造完美一週的方法。第一個領域
是從大石頭開始。這些是
不可協商的。這些是
你知道如果完成了，
其他一切都會好的事情。這
是約會之夜、運動、
閱讀時間、策略會議、
與團隊的每週節奏、
最佳生活的最佳實踐。第二個
領域是了解將你的
日子主題化，用於不同的事情，例如
行銷、銷售、策略、一對一會議，
這將幫助你了解在哪些日子將事情
安排在你的生活中，這樣就不是每次都要做決定。
第三個領域是將任務批次處理和區塊化。
將你的內容
創作或所有對話
批次處理並在你的
日曆中區塊化為30或45分鐘的會議，
這是一個遊戲規則的改變者。最
重要的是根據你的精力來規劃，
而不僅僅是你的時間。我知道有些
類型的任務我在早上做，
會激勵我進入下一個層次的任務，
這會激勵我到下午，
這會激勵我到晚上與我的
家人在一起，如果我打亂了
順序，我對任何人都沒有好處。
我本來不打算這樣做，但
如果我不這樣做，那可能對我來說不太好。
基本上，如果你想要我的
完美一週範本，我每天用來
安排我一週的範本，只需在Instagram上找到我，
傳送訊息給我「完美」這個詞，
我就會把文件連結直接傳給你。
無需選擇加入，無需電子郵件，
這是我的禮物。這就引導我們到技巧
八。遊戲化你的工作。
電動遊戲之所以如此令人上癮，
是因為它們有等級，而且你
在玩的時候可以視覺化地看到你的進度。
我在生活中學到的是，新的等級，新的挑戰，
當你明白自己正在進步時，它會讓你想要進步。
所以，設計你的生活，讓你可以衡量
勝利。你不會因為無聊而分心。
你分心是因為你無法看到自己的進度。
進步就是幸福。任何現在
生活陷入困境的人，我知道
如果他們的生活有一點點
進步，他們就會感覺更好。
所以，讓我們遊戲化我們的工作，這樣我們就能
專注地投入。第一，我們必須追蹤
我們的連勝紀錄。Jelly Roll發行了
一首關於連勝紀錄的偉大歌曲。
我喜歡這種哲學，如果你
衡量自己做某事，並且
你可以日復一日地堅持下去，
每天都取得一個簡單的勝利，
如果每天有10個銷售電話，你能連續
多少天？我的朋友Ben一直在運動。
我想他前幾天說他已經連續
1200天運動了，而且他完成了他不需要做的
運動。這太瘋狂了。第二，你必須為
獎勵設定里程碑。這是我的最愛，因為我喜歡
買東西和旅行。我喜歡
用里程碑作為獎勵自己的標誌，
比如與家人或朋友的假期，
作為一個可以努力的目標。第三是讓它
視覺化。我是科技的愛好者，但我
會告訴你，當你把它放在
你面前，作為你電腦背景的
海報，把它貼在你的白板上，我不在乎它在哪裡，
但把它從你的大腦中拿出來，
放在你面前，這樣你每次都能看到它。
這會讓它變得有趣。
第四是共同完成。你能夠讓越多人
參與到獲勝的過程中，
你就會圍繞你的成果創造出前所未有的專注。
因為事實是，你會為別人做更多，
特別是如果你是那個讓他們開始
那場比賽或那個減肥計畫的人，
而不是為自己做。所以，擁有
一群人一起做，是一個專業的舉動。
這就引導我們到技巧九。管理你的精力。
耗盡身體，馴服心靈。如果你
在Instagram上關注我，如果你
沒有，你應該關注，因為我很有趣，
你會看到我幾乎每天都發文：
耗盡身體，馴服心靈。對我來說，
我的精力是我的習慣的副產品。
如果我腦子裡有很多事情，我需要專注，
我必須先耗盡我的身體。我的早晨例行公事
是我創造主動精力
提升的地方。我做的第一件事是專注於
我起床的過程，我決定做什麼。
它在我的日曆上。我運動。我讀書。
我提升我的專注力，這樣我才能完成我最好的工作。
我非常注重精力，有兩種方法
我確保我的一天能發揮最好的狀態。
首先是主動精力提升。這是我
主動開始一天的方式。這是我的
早晨例行公事。這是優先考慮
「泵」的哲學，把它排在日曆上，
確保我的東西都準備好了。如果我必須運動，
我會在前一天晚上把東西準備好，這樣當我
醒來時，它就準備好了。我不需要
有決策疲勞。另一個
是反應性精力提升。這是
當我感到精疲力盡時。也許我的眼睛
很痛。我不知道為什麼有時候會這樣。
我只是需要重新設定。
我的意思是，前幾天我正在演講，
一個傢伙問我，他說：「嘿，老兄，
你怎麼處理那種感覺
遲鈍、疲憊，好像全世界的重擔都壓在你身上？」
我說：「老兄，站到前面來，做一些
伏地挺身。」我跟他一起做了伏地挺身。
我們坐在那裡，我說：「繼續，
繼續，繼續，直到他
失敗。」當他失敗時，我說：「跪下。」
他跪下了。
然後我們都完成了。我說：「現在，
你感覺如何？」他說：「9分（滿分10分）。」
我說：「那只花了46秒。」
大多數人沒有意識到他們可以重新設定
他們的精力，因為你沒有精力。
你創造精力。我可以證明。如果我
告訴你，你銀行裡有1000萬美元現金，
稅已繳。你會有什麼感覺？
那種感覺？它從哪裡來的？從
這裡。我喜歡做的另一件事是
邊走邊開會或滑板車會議。
我所有的一對一會議都是在
滑板車上完成的。為什麼？更有趣。
這就引導我們到技巧十。找到你的
心流。你看，我從小就認為我
有問題。我被告知我有問題。需要
藥物。我11歲時開始服用利他能。
我意識到，不是我的大腦有問題，
而是我只是
需要找到一種不同的工作方式，
適合我的方式。所以，我知道的是：
你的旅程將會非常獨特。
沒有人能告訴你該怎麼做。我
可以給你一些想法，但你必須
自己去弄清楚。花時間
反思。寫下你在想什麼，
什麼有效，什麼無效。當我
這樣做時，我感覺很好。然後
不斷調整。這就是我做的。我
看我的日曆，因為它是
設計好的。我說：「那感覺很好。」
有些事情以前會給我能量，
而且非常有效率，但突然間，
現在根據我的人生階段，它
對我不再有效了。你
可以迭代。你可以
把東西拿掉，嘗試新的東西，
就像新衣服一樣。它合身嗎？如果
不合身，就脫掉。去尋找
不同的東西。但最重要的想法是
不要放棄。不要放棄你自己。
我知道，如果你掌握了
找到你的精力、專注力和
心流的能力，你的夢想就存在於
那邊。現在，如果你想學習
能解決你98%問題的八個習慣，

這份筆記介紹了10個能幫助你解鎖「瘋狂專注力」的技巧，即使有注意力不足過動症也能提高效率。

---

### 10個解鎖驚人專注力的技巧

**技巧一：列出「不去做」清單 (Make a not-to-do list)**
*   **核心理念：** 專注是一種過濾器，而非肌肉。成功是減法而非加法。
*   **清單內容：**
    *   低價值任務：任何可以付錢給別人做或用應用程式完成的事。
    *   壞習慣和惡習：例如不面對問題、賴床按貪睡鈕。
    *   能量吸血鬼：那些會消耗你精力的人。

**技巧二：創造專注觸發器 (Create focus triggers)**
*   **核心理念：** 心流狀態是設計出來的，而非隨機發生。
*   **觸發器類型：**
    *   地點：特定用於閱讀、規劃目標、構思的椅子或場所。
    *   聲音：播放無歌詞音樂或使用雙耳節拍應用程式，戴耳機避免干擾。
    *   例行公事：像世界級運動員一樣，建立日常、每週、每月的成功節奏。

**技巧三：從困難模式開始 (Start on hard mode)**
*   **核心理念：** 停止透過簡單的勝利來創造動能，直接攻擊最困難的任務。
*   **實踐方法：**
    *   選擇「一件事」：找出對你來說最重要、能帶動其他事情的任務（例如企業主的行銷，個人的運動）。
    *   深度工作區塊：在早上（或你精力最好的時間）進行深度工作，不檢查電子郵件、社交媒體等。

**技巧四：難以聯繫 (Be hard to reach)**
*   **核心理念：** 讓自己容易在網路上被找到，但難以被聯繫。
*   **實踐方法：**
    *   關閉所有通知：只允許最重要的人（例如配偶、助理）聯繫。
    *   安排回覆時間：將回覆簡訊、郵件等排入日曆，集中處理。
    *   使用專注信號：例如戴耳機表示正在專注，或設定辦公室規則（如關門時不打擾）。
    *   移除自己：選擇在無干擾的環境工作（例如在家、咖啡館、朋友會議室），甚至不帶電源線以增加壓力。

**技巧五：增加壓力 (Turn up the pressure)**
*   **核心理念：** 透過外部壓力來提高專注和效率。
*   **實踐方法：**
    *   縮短時間線：利用帕金森定律，給自己更短、更具體的截止日期。
    *   增加賭注：設定如果未達成目標會產生的負面後果，使其成為不可協商的。

**技巧六：訓練你的演算法 (Train your algorithm)**
*   **核心理念：** 利用社交媒體演算法為你服務，而非被其分心。
*   **實踐方法：**
    *   教導偏好：搜尋想學習的內容，對感興趣的影片留言，讓演算法了解你的興趣。
    *   取消關注或靜音：移除任何對你學習或成長沒有貢獻的帳戶或朋友。
    *   整合所學：分享並教導你學到的東西，加深理解。

**技巧七：設計你的完美一週 (Design your perfect week)**
*   **核心理念：** 多工處理無效，每次分心後平均需要23分鐘才能重新專注。
*   **實踐方法：**
    *   從「大石頭」開始：優先安排不可協商的重要事項（約會、運動、閱讀、策略會議）。
    *   主題化你的日子：將不同類型的任務分配到特定日期（例如行銷日、銷售日、策略日）。
    *   批次處理和區塊化任務：將類似任務集中處理，並在日曆上安排30-45分鐘的區塊。
    *   根據精力而非時間規劃：了解自己不同時間的精力水平，安排適合的任務。

**技巧八：遊戲化你的工作 (Gamify your work)**
*   **核心理念：** 像電動遊戲一樣，透過視覺化進度來保持動力和專注。
*   **實踐方法：**
    *   追蹤連勝紀錄：衡量自己連續完成某事的次數。
    *   為獎勵設定里程碑：將假期、購物等作為達成目標的獎勵。
    *   視覺化：將目標和進度放在顯眼處（海報、電腦背景、白板）。
    *   共同完成：與他人一起設定目標和競爭，利用為他人負責的動力。

**技巧九：管理你的精力 (Manage your energy)**
*   **核心理念：** 「耗盡身體，馴服心靈」；精力是創造出來的，而非擁有的。
*   **實踐方法：**
    *   主動精力提升：透過早晨例行公事（運動、閱讀、規劃）來主動創造精力。
    *   反應性精力提升：當感到疲憊時，透過快速行動（例如做伏地挺身）來重置精力。
    *   移動式會議：例如邊走邊開會或騎滑板車開會，增加樂趣和活動量。

**技巧十：找到你的心流 (Find your flow)**
*   **核心理念：** 每個人的專注旅程都是獨特的，需要找到適合自己的方式。
*   **實踐方法：**
    *   反思：花時間寫日記，思考什麼有效、什麼無效。
    *   不斷調整：檢視日曆，根據當前人生階段調整工作方式，勇於嘗試新方法。
    *   永不放棄：相信自己能掌握精力、專注和心流的能力，夢想就在彼岸。
