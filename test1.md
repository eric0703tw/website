**user**: 去除時間軸
[Context: Notes: 需翻譯_去時間軸/Fix your destructive mindset in 15 mins _ Anne-Laure Le Cunff-en.md]

**ai**: 好的，這是去除時間軸後的內容：

- A mindset is a default way of seeing the world.
And our mindsets influence so many things in our lives.
They influence our decisions.
They influence our relationships.
They influence the way we think and even the way we feel.
When we're not aware of our mindsets,
they can impact the direction of our life,
the path that we're taking without us even realizing it.
Being aware of your mindsets
is the difference between living a conscious life,
where you're making choices
in accord with what you actually want
and going where you actually wanna go,
versus being on autopilot and having those mindsets
subconsciously drive all of your decisions.
The great thing about mindsets
is that they can actually change,
but the first step is to make them conscious.
(light thoughtful music)
I divide my life into two separate chapters.
In the first one, I had a very linear approach
that was driven by traditional definitions of success.
I did my best to do well in school,
and then I got a good job at Google,
and then I tried to climb the corporate ladder,
getting a promotion, working on the best projects possible.
And from an external standpoint,
I should have been happy, but I wasn't.
Instead, I was feeling empty inside;
I was both bored and burned out.
I left my job at Google,
thinking that I should try to do something different
and not realizing that I was following
yet another script of success.
I decided to start a startup.
And again, I didn't find happiness there
by following this idea of success
that everyone around me was following.
It's only when my startup failed
and that, for the very first time in my life,
I didn't have a clear idea of what I was supposed to do next
in order to be successful, that I finally asked myself:
What is it that I wanted to do?
What would make me happy, even if I forgot about
the traditional definition of success?
And so I went back to the drawing board,
and I started thinking about what I was curious about.
Again, not based on traditional definitions of success.
What were topics I would be excited to explore,
even if nobody was watching?
And for me, that was the brain.
I had always been fascinated
with why we think the way we think
and why we feel the way we feel.
So I decided to go back to university to study neuroscience.
I completed my graduate studies,
and I got a PhD in neuroscience.
Throughout this journey, I decided to learn in public,
and this is how I started my newsletter.
Every week, I would pick a topic
that I had discovered in my studies in university,
and I would take those neuroscience insights
and turn them into practical tools
that I would write about in the newsletter
to help other people apply them in their life and work.
This tiny experiment of starting to write online
and sharing what I was learning in public
was the beginning of my work of trying to understand
how we can live more experimental lives.
There are three subconscious mindsets
that get in the way of us living happy, conscious lives.
These three mindsets are called the cynical mindset,
the escapist mindset, and the perfectionist mindset.
The cynical mindset is when we have lost all curiosity
and ambition in life,
and we're actually sometimes even making fun
of earnest people who still have this high level
of curiosity and ambition.
When we're cynical, we feel like there's no point in trying
because we're in survival mode all the time,
so things that we might be doing instead are doom scrolling,
sitting on the sofa, going through negative news,
being stuck in this cycle,
and then maybe even spending a lot of time and energy
discussing and debating those negative news
with other people.
In the escapist mindset, we're still curious,
but we have decided to let go of our ambitions.
With the escapist mindset,
we're trying to do everything we can
to escape our responsibilities.
That can take the form of retail therapy, binge-watching,
or dream planning our next vacation
instead of doing something right now to change our lives.
In the perfectionist mindset,
we try to escape uncertainty through work,
so we have high ambition but low curiosity.
That might look like self-coercion, overworking ourselves,
toxic productivity.
Our goals are driving all of our decisions.
We feel like if we manage to achieve that goal,
if we manage to be successful then then we'll be happy.
You can picture those three subconscious mindsets
on the four-by-four metrics,
where the two different factors are curiosity and ambition.
In the case of the cynical mindset,
it's low curiosity, low ambition;
for the escapist mindset, high curiosity but low ambition;
and with the perfectionist mindset,
you do have high ambition,
but you have decided to let go of your curiosity.
Those mindsets are actually very fluid,
and they might change depending on our situation
and different triggers
and different ambitions that we might have at the moment.
This is actually really good news
because that means that these mindsets
are not fixed personality traits.
We can change them by becoming aware of them
and then making the decision to change our mindsets.
This is something we can achieve.
There is an alternative to those three mindsets,
which is called the experimental mindset.
This is a mindset where your curiosity
and your ambition are both high.
In an experimental mindset, you're open to uncertainty.
You see it as an opportunity to explore, to grow,
and to learn.
Having an experimental mindset helps us completely reimagine
our relationship to ambition and to goals.
When you have an experimental mindset,
instead of chasing those linear goals
that give you the illusion of certainty,
you're open to designing experiments.
Instead of trying to get to a specific outcome,
you start from a research question.
Anytime you don't understand something,
it doesn't create fear, it creates curiosity.
Having an experimental mindset means seeing failures
as data points that you can learn from.
It means being open to making mistakes
because you know you're going to learn from them.
It means embracing the fact that you might not have a plan,
that you don't know what's coming, and this is great.
It means that you can design your life
in a way that is conscious and connected.
The idea of cultivating an experimental mindset
is based on the scientific method, and this is very simple.
First, you start by observing your current situation
by looking at the world around you.
Then you ask a research question,
and you design a tiny experiment to collect data,
which you can then analyze.
Based on those results,
you can decide what your next step is.
What's great about that
is that even though you don't know where you're going,
you can trust that you're going to grow
through each cycle of experimentation.
To design an experiment, you need to commit to curiosity.
A great way to do this is to design what I call a pact.
This is a commitment device
where you say, "I am going to run this experiment."
The way it works is that you choose one action,
and you then decide on a duration,
and you say, "I will perform this action
for this specific duration.
Why does it look like that?
There are several reasons.
The first one is that
when a scientist designs an experiment,
they design in advance on the number of trials.
You don't simply stop in the middle
if the results don't really look like what you expected.
You collect all of the data,
and once you have all of that data,
you can analyze it and decide what the answer is.
The second reason is that it allows you to notice
when you're falling prey to the maximized brain.
You can make sure that you're keeping your experiment
tiny enough that you're actually going to complete it
by choosing a duration that is reasonable,
something you can actually achieve,
so you can collect all of the necessary data.
A pact is purposeful.
It needs to be something you care about,
and what's great is that when each pact you design
has purpose imbued into it,
you don't need to have a grand purpose in life.
A pact is actionable.
This is something that you need to be able to do right now.
You don't need extra resources.
You don't need help from other people.
This is something you can try straight away.
A pact is continuous.
This is something that you need to do regularly.
Again, you decide on the duration, the number of trials,
and then you say, "I'm going to do this action
for two weeks.
I'm going to do this action for two months.
I'm going to do this action for one year."
And finally, a pact is trackable, not measurable.
You don't need complicated metrics.
You only need to be able to say whether you did it or not.
Did you do the action?
Did you perform it?
Yes or no?
That's the only tracking you need.
A pact is not a New Year resolution.
This is not something that you decide on
that is very ambitious at the beginning of the year
and that you're going to abandon.
This is something small and achievable
that you can start doing at any point during the year.
A pact is not a habit either.
The difference between a habit and an experiment
is that, with a habit, you're very clear
that this is something that's going to be good for you,
and so you commit to it for an indefinite amount of time.
For example, you say, "Starting today,
I'm going to go to bed at the same time."
Whereas, with an experiment, you're not quite sure
whether this is going to work for you or not.
You're going to test it, and so you're going to say,
"I'm going to go to bed
at the same time every night for two weeks.
And then only I'm going to decide
whether this is good for me or not
and whether I want to turn it into a habit."
A pact is not a KPI, an OKR, a performance metric,
or however people call them in the corporate world.
It's really just about learning something new.
It's not about being successful
or getting to a specific outcome.
Once you've completed your pact
and you've gone through the entire duration
of that data collection phase,
you can finally look at the data.
I highly encourage you, while you're running your pact,
to take little notes.
It can be very simple, a few bullet points on your phone,
something in your journal, but just to keep track
of whether you did it or not and how it felt.
Based on that, you can make the decision
to either persist with your pact as is
because it works for you.
You can also pause it
if you feel like that's not really something
you want to keep going with.
Or you can pivot, which means making a little tweak
and changing something
before you start your next cycle of experimentation.
A lot of us tend to only pay attention to external data
or internal data when we're analyzing our experiments.
For example, we might only look
at the external metrics of success
or only at the internal feelings
that we might be experiencing.
But both are very valuable
in order to make the right decision
when it comes to your next steps.
The external signals might show you
whether this is something that is worth pursuing
in terms of financial success or career
or any ambition that you might want to explore.
But the internal signals are also very important.
There's no point being successful externally
if it feels horrible to work on this project.
And equally, if it feels really good,
but you have no way to sustain yourself with this project,
it might be worth reconsidering the parameters
to find a way where you can have an overlap
between external success and also internal positive feelings
and emotions of working on this.
Let me give you an example.
I designed an experiment where I wanted to explore
whether I wanted to become a YouTuber.
This was something I had noticed
a lot of friends around me doing,
and they seemed to have a lot of fun.
That piqued my curiosity enough
that I wanted to give it a try.
So I designed a pact,
and I said, "I'm going to publish a video every week
until the end of the year."
Very simple pact, which I completed.
Every week, I published a new video.
At the end of my pact, I looked at the data.
External data?
Pretty good.
Looking at the traditional metrics
of success of a YouTube channel,
I got to a good number of subscribers,
a lot of positive comments.
People seemed to like the videos,
and I even had some people reaching out
and asking if we could collaborate together.
But internal data.
I actually did not enjoy producing these videos.
Every week, when I had to sit down in front of the camera,
I was dreading it.
I love having face-to-face conversations with people
and seeing their reactions in real-time,
but just looking at a camera with no feedback whatsoever
was very uncomfortable for me.
As a result, every week I was procrastinating for so long
every time I had to film a video.
I felt deeply anxious,
and I was not even able to work on anything else
on those days where I was supposed to film.
This is a typical example showing why it is so important
to considering both the external
and the internal signals before making a decision.
Based on this, even though the YouTube channel
was fairly successful in such a short amount of time,
I decided to stop.
I realized that I was not going to be a YouTuber,
and I prefer to keep on writing my newsletter.
You can run tiny experiments in all areas of your life.
In work, for example, you could say,
"I'm going to write an internal newsletter
every week for the next six weeks,
where I share the most interesting links that I find."
In relationships, you could say,
"I'm going every Sunday to sit down
and send a note to a friend I haven't talked to in a while."
And even when it comes to your health, you could say,
"I'm going to go for a walk
for 20 minutes for 20 days
to see how I feel at the end of that experiment."
With an experiment, you're not making any assumptions
as to whether this is going to work for you or not.
A habit that a friend has,
for example, going for a run three times a week,
might not be that good for you.
Maybe when it comes to your health and body movement,
you prefer dancing or something else.
That's why it's interesting to run an experiment
before committing to a habit.
When it comes to running, for example,
you could say, "I'm going to try that.
I am going to go and run three times a week
for three weeks, not for the rest of my life.
And at the end of the three weeks,
I'm going to decide whether this is what I wanna keep doing
or if I wanna experiment with another way to move my body."
In essence, committing to curiosity
is ensuring that you're going to live a life
that is intentional, that you're going to live your life,
not the life that other people are expecting you to live.
Curiosity keeps you adaptable
and nimble in an ever-changing world.
It ensures that you stay open to new possibilities,
and, frankly, it just makes life more fun.
This all might sound philosophical,
but there's actually a lot of neuroscientific research
showing that when we experience thirst for water,
the same parts of the brain activate
then when we experience thirst for information.
So when we say, "I'm thirsty for knowledge;
I wanna learn more; I wanna know more,"
we couldn't be more right.
And thinking about your own mindsets,
developing this self-awareness
is really just a way to direct this curiosity
towards the things that you
actually wanna do with your life.

**ai**: 好的，這是該筆記的繁體中文翻譯：

- 心態是看待世界的預設方式。
我們的心態影響著我們生活中的許多事情。
它們影響我們的決策。
它們影響我們的人際關係。
它們影響我們的思維方式，甚至我們的感受方式。
當我們沒有意識到自己的心態時，
它們可能會影響我們生活的方向，
我們所走的道路，而我們甚至沒有意識到。
意識到你的心態
是過著有意識的生活的區別，
在這種生活中，你根據自己真正想要的做出選擇
並走向你真正想去的地方，
而不是自動駕駛，讓那些心態
潛意識地驅動你所有的決策。
心態最棒的地方在於
它們實際上是可以改變的，
但第一步是讓它們變得有意識。
（輕柔沉思的音樂）
我將我的生活分為兩個不同的章節。
在第一個章節中，我採用了一種非常線性的方法，
這種方法是由傳統的成功定義所驅動的。
我盡力在學校表現出色，
然後我在 Google 找到了一份好工作，
然後我試圖攀登企業階梯，
獲得晉升，參與最好的專案。
從外部角度來看，
我應該是快樂的，但我不是。
相反，我內心感到空虛；
我既無聊又筋疲力盡。
我離開了 Google 的工作，
認為我應該嘗試做一些不同的事情，
卻沒有意識到我正在追隨
另一個成功的劇本。
我決定創業。
但同樣，我並沒有在那裡找到快樂，
因為我追隨的是周圍每個人都在追隨的
這種成功理念。
直到我的創業失敗，
而且，在我生命中第一次，
我對接下來該做什麼才能成功
沒有明確的想法時，我才終於問自己：
我真正想做什麼？
即使我忘記了
傳統的成功定義，什麼會讓我快樂？
於是我回到了起點，
開始思考我對什麼感到好奇。
同樣，這不是基於傳統的成功定義。
有哪些主題會讓我興奮地去探索，
即使沒有人關注？
對我來說，那就是大腦。
我一直對此著迷
為什麼我們會這樣思考
以及為什麼我們會這樣感受。
於是我決定回到大學學習神經科學。
我完成了我的研究生學業，
並獲得了神經科學博士學位。
在整個旅程中，我決定公開學習，
這就是我開始我的電子報的方式。
每週，我都會選擇一個主題，
那是我在大學學習中發現的，
然後我會將這些神經科學的見解
轉化為實用的工具，
我會在電子報中撰寫這些工具，
以幫助其他人將它們應用到他們的生活和工作中。
這個開始在網路上寫作
並公開分享我所學的小實驗
是我試圖理解
我們如何才能過上更具實驗性的生活的開端。
有三種潛意識心態
阻礙我們過上快樂、有意識的生活。
這三種心態被稱為犬儒心態、
逃避心態和完美主義心態。
犬儒心態是指我們失去了生活中所有的好奇心
和抱負，
我們有時甚至會嘲笑
那些仍然充滿高度
好奇心和抱負的認真的人。
當我們犬儒時，我們覺得嘗試沒有意義，
因為我們一直處於生存模式，
所以我們可能會做的事情是刷手機、
坐在沙發上、瀏覽負面新聞、
陷入這個循環中，
然後甚至可能花費大量的時間和精力
與其他人討論和辯論
這些負面新聞。
在逃避心態中，我們仍然好奇，
但我們決定放棄我們的抱負。
帶著逃避心態，
我們試圖盡一切可能
逃避我們的責任。
這可能表現為購物療法、追劇、
或夢想規劃我們的下一個假期，
而不是現在就做些什麼來改變我們的生活。
在完美主義心態中，
我們試圖透過工作來逃避不確定性，
所以我們有很高的抱負，但好奇心很低。
這可能看起來像是自我強迫、過度勞累、
有毒的生產力。
我們的目標驅動著我們所有的決策。
我們覺得如果我們能夠實現那個目標，
如果我們能夠成功，那麼我們就會快樂。
你可以將這三種潛意識心態
想像成一個四乘四的矩陣，
其中兩個不同的因素是好奇心和抱負。
在犬儒心態的情況下，
是低好奇心、低抱負；
對於逃避心態，是高好奇心但低抱負；
而對於完美主義心態，
你確實有很高的抱負，
但你決定放棄你的好奇心。
這些心態實際上是非常流動的，
它們可能會根據我們的情況
以及不同的觸發因素
和我們當時可能有的不同抱負而改變。
這實際上是個好消息，
因為這意味著這些心態
不是固定的性格特徵。
我們可以透過意識到它們
然後做出改變我們心態的決定來改變它們。
這是我們可以實現的。
這三種心態還有另一種選擇，
稱為實驗心態。
這是一種你的好奇心
和抱負都非常高的心態。
在實驗心態中，你對不確定性持開放態度。
你將其視為探索、成長、
和學習的機會。
擁有實驗心態有助於我們完全重新想像
我們與抱負和目標的關係。
當你擁有實驗心態時，
你不會追逐那些線性的目標，
那些給你確定性錯覺的目標，
而是樂於設計實驗。
你不是試圖達到一個特定的結果，
而是從一個研究問題開始。
任何時候你不明白某件事，
它不會產生恐懼，它會產生好奇心。
擁有實驗心態意味著將失敗
視為你可以從中學習的數據點。
這意味著樂於犯錯，
因為你知道你會從中學習。
這意味著接受你可能沒有計劃的事實，
你不知道接下來會發生什麼，這很棒。
這意味著你可以設計你的生活，
以一種有意識且相互關聯的方式。
培養實驗心態的想法
是基於科學方法，這非常簡單。
首先，你從觀察你目前的狀況開始，
透過觀察你周圍的世界。
然後你提出一個研究問題，
並設計一個小實驗來收集數據，
然後你可以分析這些數據。
根據這些結果，
你可以決定你的下一步是什麼。
這很棒的地方在於，
即使你不知道自己要去哪裡，
你也可以相信你會透過每個實驗週期而成長。
要設計一個實驗，你需要投入好奇心。
一個很好的方法是設計我稱之為「約定」（pact）的東西。
這是一種承諾裝置，
你說：「我將要進行這個實驗。」
它的運作方式是，你選擇一個行動，
然後你決定一個持續時間，
然後你說：「我將執行這個行動
在特定的持續時間內。」
為什麼會是這樣？
有幾個原因。
第一個原因是，
當科學家設計實驗時，
他們會預先設計好試驗次數。
你不會因為結果不如預期
就半途而廢。
你會收集所有數據，
一旦你擁有了所有數據，
你就可以分析它並決定答案是什麼。
第二個原因是，它讓你能夠注意到
你何時落入「最大化大腦」的陷阱。
你可以確保你的實驗
足夠小，以至於你實際上能夠完成它，
透過選擇一個合理的持續時間，
一個你確實可以實現的目標，
這樣你就可以收集所有必要的數據。
約定是有目的的。
它需要是你關心的事情，
而且很棒的是，當你設計的每個約定
都充滿了目的時，
你就不需要擁有一個宏大的人生目標。
約定是可執行的。
這是你現在就能做的事情。
你不需要額外的資源。
你不需要其他人的幫助。
這是你可以立即嘗試的事情。
約定是持續的。
這是你需要定期做的事情。
同樣，你決定持續時間、試驗次數，
然後你說：「我將執行這個行動
持續兩週。
我將執行這個行動持續兩個月。
我將執行這個行動持續一年。」
最後，約定是可追蹤的，而不是可衡量的。
你不需要複雜的指標。
你只需要能夠說你是否做到了。
你做了這個行動嗎？
你執行了嗎？
是或否？
這就是你唯一需要的追蹤。
約定不是新年新希望。
這不是你在年初決定的一個
非常雄心勃勃的目標，
然後你會放棄它。
這是一個小而可實現的目標，
你可以在一年中的任何時候開始做。
約定也不是一種習慣。
習慣和實驗的區別在於，
對於習慣，你非常清楚
這對你來說是件好事，
所以你無限期地承諾去做。
例如，你說：「從今天開始，
我每天都要在同一時間上床睡覺。」
然而，對於實驗，你不太確定
這是否會對你有效。
你會去測試它，所以你會說：
「我將在兩週內每晚
在同一時間上床睡覺。
然後我才會決定
這對我來說是否是好事，
以及我是否想把它變成一種習慣。」
約定不是 KPI、OKR、績效指標，
或者企業界人們稱呼它們的任何名稱。
它真的只是關於學習新事物。
它不是關於成功
或達到一個特定的結果。
一旦你完成了你的約定
並經歷了整個數據收集階段，
你就可以最終查看數據了。
我強烈建議你，在執行約定期間，
記下一些小筆記。
可以很簡單，手機上的幾個重點，
日記裡的一些內容，但只是為了記錄
你是否做到了以及感覺如何。
基於此，你可以決定
是繼續你的約定，
因為它對你有效。
你也可以暫停它，
如果你覺得這不是你真正想繼續的事情。
或者你可以轉向，這意味著做一些小調整
並改變一些東西，
然後再開始你的下一個實驗週期。
我們很多人在分析實驗時，
往往只關注外部數據
或內部數據。
例如，我們可能只看
成功的外部指標，
或者只看我們可能正在經歷的
內部感受。
但兩者都非常有價值，
以便在決定下一步時
做出正確的決策。
外部信號可能會告訴你
這是否值得追求，
就財務成功或職業而言，
或任何你可能想探索的抱負。
但內部信號也非常重要。
如果做這個專案感覺很糟糕，
那麼外部成功就沒有意義。
同樣地，如果感覺真的很好，
但你沒有辦法靠這個專案維持生計，
那麼可能值得重新考慮參數，
找到一種方法，讓你可以同時擁有
外部成功和內部積極感受，
以及對這項工作的熱情。
讓我給你一個例子。
我設計了一個實驗，我想探索
我是否想成為一名 YouTuber。
這是我注意到
周圍很多朋友都在做的事情，
他們似乎玩得很開心。
這足以激發我的好奇心，
讓我想嘗試一下。
於是我設計了一個約定，
我說：「我將每週發布一個影片，
直到年底。」
一個非常簡單的約定，我完成了。
每週，我都會發布一個新影片。
在我的約定結束時，我查看了數據。
外部數據？
相當不錯。
從 YouTube 頻道成功的傳統指標來看，
我獲得了不錯的訂閱人數，
很多正面的評論。
人們似乎喜歡這些影片，
甚至有人主動聯繫我，
詢問我們是否可以合作。
但內部數據呢？
我實際上並不喜歡製作這些影片。
每週，當我必須坐在鏡頭前時，
我都感到非常害怕。
我喜歡與人面對面交談，
並即時看到他們的反應，
但只是看著鏡頭，沒有任何回饋，
這讓我非常不舒服。
結果，每週我都會拖延很久，
每次我必須拍攝影片時。
我感到非常焦慮，
而且在那些我應該拍攝影片的日子裡，
我甚至無法做其他任何事情。
這是一個典型的例子，說明了為什麼在做決定之前，
同時考慮外部和內部信號是如此重要。
基於此，儘管這個 YouTube 頻道
在如此短的時間內相當成功，
我還是決定停止。
我意識到我不會成為一名 YouTuber，
我更喜歡繼續寫我的電子報。
你可以在生活的各個領域進行小實驗。
例如，在工作中，你可以說：
「我將在接下來的六週內，每週撰寫一份內部電子報，
分享我發現的最有趣的連結。」
在人際關係中，你可以說：
「我將每個星期天坐下來，
給一位我很久沒聯繫的朋友寫一封信。」
甚至在健康方面，你也可以說：
「我將連續 20 天每天散步 20 分鐘，
看看實驗結束時我的感覺如何。」
透過實驗，你不會對
這是否會對你有效做出任何假設。
朋友的一個習慣，
例如，每週跑步三次，
可能對你來說並不好。
也許當談到你的健康和身體運動時，
你更喜歡跳舞或其他什麼。
這就是為什麼在養成習慣之前
進行實驗很有趣。
例如，談到跑步，
你可以說：「我會嘗試一下。
我將每週跑步三次，
持續三週，而不是一輩子。
在三週結束時，
我會決定這是否是我想要繼續做的事情，
或者我是否想嘗試另一種運動方式。」
本質上，投入好奇心
是確保你將過上
有目的的生活，你將過你自己的生活，
而不是別人期望你過的生活。
好奇心讓你在這個不斷變化的世界中保持適應性
和靈活。
它確保你對新的可能性保持開放，
坦率地說，它只是讓生活更有趣。
這一切聽起來可能很哲學，
但實際上有很多神經科學研究表明，
當我們感到口渴時，
大腦中相同的部位會被激活，
就像我們對資訊感到渴望時一樣。
所以當我們說：「我渴望知識；
我想學更多；我想知道更多，」
我們再正確不過了。
而思考你自己的心態，
培養這種自我意識，
實際上只是一種引導這種好奇心的方式，
將其導向你真正想做的事情。

**ai**: 好的，這份筆記的結構化內容整理如下：

## 修正破壞性思維模式 (Fix your destructive mindset)

### 一、 心態的定義與影響
- 心態是看待世界的預設方式。
- 它影響我們的決策、人際關係、思維方式和感受。
- 當我們沒有意識到自己的心態時，它們會潛意識地驅動我們的決策，影響我們的人生方向。
- 意識到心態是過上有意識生活、根據自身意願做出選擇的關鍵。
- 心態是可以改變的，第一步是讓它們變得有意識。

### 二、 講者的個人經歷
- **第一章：線性成功模式**
    - 追求傳統的成功定義：好學校、Google 工作、攀升企業階梯、最佳專案。
    - 結果：外部成功，但內心感到空虛、無聊和筋疲力盡。
    - 離開 Google 後創業，但仍舊追隨「成功劇本」，未能找到快樂。
- **轉折點：回歸好奇心**
    - 創業失敗後，第一次對下一步沒有明確想法。
    - 自問：「我真正想做什麼？什麼會讓我快樂，即使不符合傳統成功定義？」
    - 重新思考好奇心：對大腦運作方式（思維與感受）產生濃厚興趣。
    - 回大學學習神經科學，獲得博士學位。
    - 透過電子報公開學習，將神經科學見解轉化為實用工具。
    - 這段經歷成為理解如何過上「實驗性生活」的開端。

### 三、 三種潛意識的破壞性心態
這些心態阻礙我們過上快樂、有意識的生活，可透過「好奇心」和「抱負」兩個維度來理解：

1.  **犬儒心態 (Cynical Mindset)**
    - **特徵**：失去所有好奇心和抱負，甚至嘲笑有抱負的人。
    - **感受**：覺得嘗試沒有意義，長期處於生存模式。
    - **行為**：刷手機、坐沙發、瀏覽負面新聞、與人討論負面新聞。
    - **好奇心/抱負**：低好奇心，低抱負。

2.  **逃避心態 (Escapist Mindset)**
    - **特徵**：仍有好奇心，但放棄抱負。
    - **行為**：試圖逃避責任（例如：購物療法、追劇、規劃假期而非實際行動）。
    - **好奇心/抱負**：高好奇心，低抱負。

3.  **完美主義心態 (Perfectionist Mindset)**
    - **特徵**：透過工作逃避不確定性，高抱負但低好奇心。
    - **行為**：自我強迫、過度勞累、追求「有毒的生產力」。
    - **感受**：目標驅動所有決策，認為只有成功才能帶來快樂。
    - **好奇心/抱負**：高抱負，低好奇心。

- **重要提示**：這些心態是流動且可改變的，並非固定的性格特徵。

### 四、 實驗心態 (Experimental Mindset)
- **定義**：好奇心和抱負都高。
- **特徵**：
    - 對不確定性持開放態度，視其為探索、成長和學習的機會。
    - 重新定義與抱負和目標的關係。
    - 樂於設計實驗，而非追逐給予確定性錯覺的線性目標。
    - 從研究問題開始，而非預設特定結果。
    - 不理解時產生好奇心而非恐懼。
    - 將失敗視為可學習的數據點，樂於犯錯。
    - 接受沒有計劃、不知道未來，並認為這很棒。
    - 以有意識且相互關聯的方式設計生活。
- **基礎**：基於科學方法，包含三個簡單步驟：
    1.  觀察現狀。
    2.  提出研究問題，設計小型實驗收集數據。
    3.  分析數據，決定下一步。
- **好處**：即使不知道最終目的地，也能相信會透過每個實驗週期而成長。

### 五、 設計實驗：「約定」(Pact)
- **承諾好奇心**：透過設計「約定」來實踐。
- **約定定義**：一種承諾裝置，選擇一個行動和一個持續時間，並承諾在該期間內執行此行動。
- **約定的原因**：
    1.  像科學家一樣預先設定試驗次數，不因結果不如預期而中途停止。
    2.  避免「最大化大腦」的陷阱，確保實驗足夠小且可完成，以收集必要數據。
- **約定的特點 (PACCT)**：
    - **有目的 (Purposeful)**：是你關心的事情，不需要宏大的人生目標。
    - **可執行 (Actionable)**：現在就能做，不需要額外資源或他人幫助。
    - **持續性 (Continuous)**：需要定期執行，並預設持續時間（例如：兩週、兩個月、一年）。
    - **可追蹤 (Trackable)**：只需判斷「是」或「否」（是否執行了行動），不需要複雜的衡量指標。

### 六、 分析實驗結果
- **數據收集**：在執行約定期間，記下簡單的筆記（例如：手機重點、日記），記錄是否做到以及感受。
- **決策**：根據數據決定下一步：
    - **堅持 (Persist)**：如果約定有效且感覺良好，則繼續執行。
    - **暫停 (Pause)**：如果覺得不適合或不想繼續，則停止。
    - **轉向 (Pivot)**：做一些小調整或改變，然後開始下一個實驗週期。
- **數據考量**：同時重視外部數據和內部數據。
    - **外部信號**：財務成功、職業發展等客觀指標。
    - **內部信號**：個人感受、情緒體驗。
    - **平衡**：外部成功但感覺糟糕沒有意義；感覺良好但無法維持生計也需調整。目標是找到外部成功與內部積極感受的重疊點。

### 七、 約定的實例
- **工作**：「我將在接下來的六週內，每週撰寫一份內部電子報，分享我發現的最有趣的連結。」
- **人際關係**：「我將每個星期天坐下來，給一位我很久沒聯繫的朋友寫一封信。」
- **健康**：「我將連續 20 天每天散步 20 分鐘，看看實驗結束時我的感覺如何。」

### 八、 約定與其他概念的區別
- **不是新年新希望**：約定是小而可實現的，可在一年中任何時候開始，而非年初雄心勃勃但易放棄的目標。
- **不是習慣**：習慣是明確知道對自己有益並無限期承諾的行為；約定則是在不確定是否有效的情況下，測試一段時間後再決定是否轉為習慣。
- **不是 KPI/OKR/績效指標**：約定純粹是為了學習新事物，而非追求成功或特定結果。

### 九、 結論：好奇心與自我意識的重要性
- **投入好奇心**：確保過上有目的、有意識的生活，而非他人期望的生活。
- **好奇心的益處**：使我們在不斷變化的世界中保持適應性和靈活，對新的可能性保持開放，並讓生活更有趣。
- **神經科學支持**：對水的渴望與對資訊的渴望會激活大腦中相同的部位，印證了「渴望知識」的說法。
- **自我意識**：思考自身心態並培養自我意識，是將好奇心導向真正想做的事情的有效方式。

**ai**: 好的，這是去除時間軸後的內容：

you can actually run experiments on the
side of doing other things your tiny
experiments don't necessarily have to
completely replace whatever other
projects you're working on Anor is an
entrepreneur the author of Nest Labs an
ex Google employee and now the author of
a new book tiny experiments I'm a
neuroscientist I am obsessed with
curiosity at Google we were encouraged
to be curious within that limited
playground in this video we sit down and
talk about how to run experiments to
improve your life instead of setting
goals up to the moment where my startup
failed I hadn't really considered Life
as a giant experiment that was the
moment where something really clicked
for me you're literally taking the
uncertainty and you're turning it into
something generative and action driven
again these aren't goals they're ways to
transform your life iteratively one
experiment at a time the way to do this
is to fill a very simple template that I
call I am Laura thank you so much for
joining me today thank you for having me
I'm excited for those of you people who
may not know who you are what is one
thing they should know about you that'll
provide like some context here with what
we're about to talk about I obsessed
with curiosity I'm a neuroscientist I
study neuroscience at the ADHD research
lab at Kings College London and I write
a newsletter every week that is all
about systematic curiousity and mindful
productivity I really see my life in two
different chapters there was a first
chapter that was very linear where I was
very focused on success I used to work
at Google I worked on a couple of
startups the traditional definition of
success getting a good job getting
promoted working on cool projects making
money all of that and it's only when my
startup fell that I went back to
University to study neuroscience and
started that second chapter of my life
where I'm a lot more experimental and
trying new
things what does it look like to run a
tiny experiment in your life so if you
want to design a tiny experiment it all
starts with observation and I know for a
lot of us and especially in the
productivity space we like doing things
we like building things we like the
action of exploring discovering so I
know it can create a little bit of
resistance to just say hey for now
actually we're just going to observe and
you take little notes no judgment just
observing based on that
you start formulating a hypothesis so
you looked at the way things are and you
start asking what might be what might be
different maybe I would actually enjoy
doing this thing differently maybe I
would enjoy doing more of that work just
using your instinct to see if something
is really picking your curiosity you can
start designing your first tiny
experiment the way to do this is to fill
a very simple template that I call a PCT
which I Define as a commitment to
curiosity I will will insert an action
or insert a duration so for example I
will write a weekly news letter every
week for the next six weeks I will go on
a daily walk every day for the next two
weeks and listen to a new podcast I will
read one research paper every Monday for
the next five weeks and I will take
notes and then share it in a substack
you do it you don't you withhold
judgment you don't try to analyze it yet
you just conduct the experiment and you
wait until done and you've gone through
all of these repetitions to look back
and see how that actually
felt for many people myself included I
when I think about actual like
experiments it kind of seems to be the
domain of academics and it might make it
feel like whatever experiment I'm
running I'm doing wrong so I'm curious
what are the telltale signs of running a
for lack of a better good experiment in
your life number one sign that you're
running a good experiment might not be
what you would expect but it's whether
you're excited about it are you actually
excited to explore this question to try
new things in that area of your life if
not that's already a good sign that
maybe that's not worth exploring so
something you are actually curious about
your level of curiosity is a good factor
to look at the second one is whether
it's doable can you actually complete
the experiment if you went for something
really ambitious and you never finish
collecting the data then that's not a
good experiment that's why it's always
better to try to go for something a
little bit smaller and shorter if you're
in doubt if you want to experiment with
meditation for example maybe try it for
10 days first don't go to a vpaa retreat
straight away try to do something a
little bit more manageable first same
for the newsletter again with my first
one I went really extreme I said 100
days but since then I have refined My
Method a lot and I have realized that
it's a lot easier to stick to something
that is smaller so don't necessarily go
for the 100 articles in a 100 days just
say what would it look like maybe six
newsletters over the next six weeks and
number three something that is out of
your comfort zone something where you
will learn something new and not
something that is optimized for Success
if you're picking an experiment because
it feels really comfortable and you feel
like if I do this I know I'll get this
result and this is great this is more of
a regular project it's not really an
experiment an experiment needs to start
from a place of uncertainty you don't
already have the answer you have a
hypothesis you might have an inkling of
an answer you might feel like maybe I'll
enjoy this maybe this will help maybe
this will make me more productive but
I'm not 100% sure that's why I'm running
the experiment so those would be the
three factors I would look at in terms
of Designing a good experiment one thing
that I love so much about this model
that you create is its form factor for
lack of a better it's in the title tiny
experiment so this idea that even if you
have a fulltime job or you have busy
family life or something like that you
can run these experiments I believe that
you can actually run experiments on the
side of doing other things and that your
tiny experiments don't necessarily have
to completely replace whatever other
projects you're working on they can be
just a way to maybe discover another
area of your life where you want to
explore where you want to try new things
and in fact I know that for some people
they do like to stick to something
fairly stable in one area of their life
and experiment a lot in another so you
might say you know what actually I have
this job and I could do it with my eyes
closed I know exactly what I'm doing
I've been working in this world for
quite a few years I'm not going to
experiment there I'm very happy with the
way it works but I'm going to experiment
a lot with my health I want to figure
out what works what doesn't for me I'm
going to experiment with different gym
routines I'm going to try different
diets I'm going to experiment with the
time at which I go to bed for example
I'm going to keep track and see how that
impacts my creativity and my
productivity one thing that I've always
found interesting about the scientific
method is that most people when they're
conducting experiments are trying to
find ways to prove themselves wrong and
that's not at all the case really when
we think about personal productivity a
lot of times we try things out and we
are so scared of failure it's like the
worst possible thing to prove ourselves
wrong and I'm kind of curious how this
very well tested approach to developing
the best knowledge we have somehow feels
so hard when we bring it into our own
lives yeah this is actually a question
that's very close to my heart which is
how can we reinvent our relationship to
failure and I do think that having an
experimental mindset can help a lot I
have a an entire chapter in the book
where I talk about my problem with the
traditional definition of goals and
these are great if you want to make sure
that you achieve a very narrow
definition of success so it's a much
more experimental approach versus that
linear smart goal type of approach that
a lot of us are using in our
productivity systems the only goal a
scientist has is to learn something new
if by the end of exper the experiment
you collected new data and you learn
something something new whether it's
something new about the world about your
work or about yourself then that's
success and I know for a lot of people
it feels less satisfying because there's
less of the sense of a an end goal and a
destination and a milestone that you get
to but this is how you can ensure that
you keep on growing even though you
don't really know where you're going and
because of that the direction you might
take might be very different from what
you could have imagined in the first
place and that's completely okay
I'd love to hear a little bit more about
tiny experiments that aren't about
getting more done or you know getting
more followers or more money or more ABS
or something like that but just a little
bit more of a emotional and highly
personal application yeah absolutely you
don't have to only run experiments for
your work or your productivity they can
actually be very helpful for I want to
say inner curiosity this self curiousity
that where you turn your attention
inward word and you try to figure out
what is going on here what's interesting
what could change what do I want to try
you could experiment with meditation
with journaling with sitting with
yourself and observing your own thoughts
the other great thing about experiments
is that you're not committing to it for
the rest of your life like a habit where
you say to your partner for example from
now on and for the rest of our lives we
have to do this date night every Friday
you could say let's just do that for a
month or two and see if we like it or
not and then we can tweak it together
same with your work you can say I'm
actually going to try this system for a
few weeks and I'm going to see if it
works for me or not that's the
difference between an experiment and a
habit is that with the Habit you already
have the answer in terms of whether this
is good for you or not you're already
convinced that if you stick to this
habit forever this is going to be good
for you whereas with an experiment you
feel like maybe that would be good for
you but you don't assume that because it
works for other people it's going to
work for you as well so you're going to
test it and you're going to collect your
own data and based on that data you're
going to decide whether you want to keep
going tweak it or completely abandon
it what tiny experiments are you running
in your life right now if you have any
time for any tiny experiments oh that's
funny because the experiment I'm running
at the moment is based on the fact that
I have almost zero time uh so I'm
running an experiment where I'm I've
committed my practice to walk for 20
minutes every day for the next 20 days
whatever happens I'm in this promotional
phase I'm recording quite a few podcasts
I'm in meetings I have a lot of copy to
write and I could spend my entire day in
front of my computer and then be so
tired that I just lay down on my bed and
maybe watch something on Netflix and
rinse and repeat and that's when I
decided okay I need to find an
experiment that's going to help me feel
better and I'm not quite sure again I
don't have the answer is it working or
not I don't know but out of everything I
came up with that felt like the easiest
experiment to implement right now with
the mental space that I have which is
almost zero and the energy that I have
which is almost zero also so that's why
I designed this experiment in this way
just 20 minutes which is very very short
and just for the next 20 days which is
almost going to bring me to the date of
the book launch we'll see if that works
I might keep going
actually people may be hearing about
this for the first time and they may
have like no idea where to even begin
constructing a tiny experiment and given
that you're in the I have zero time for
anything space in your life are there a
couple questions maybe or prompts that
would help people kind of even think
about creating a tiny experiment
something that is very fun to do
actually and you can do very quickly is
just open your calendar and look at the
way you spent your last week that's it
and open a notebook or take some notes
but look at the meetings and ask
yourself whether some meetings gave you
energy whether others drained your
energy what felt good looking at your
calendar is a way to prompt those
thoughts ask yourself is there anything
I can change that's it is there one
thing I can change it can be very very
small and then try it next week just say
for five days I'm going to do this thing
differently and that's it you have your
first tiny experiment to start designing
your own tiny experiments pick up your
own copy of tiny experiments we will put
all that information down below as well
as different places where you can find
an L's incredible work andl thank you so
much for writing this book and spending
time with us where can people learn more
about you thank you so much for having
me you can go to nls.com where you can
subscribe to My Weekly Newsletter which
I send every Thursday and if you want to
get a copy of the book you can just look
up tiny experiments anywhere books are
sold

你實際上可以在做其他事情的同時進行實驗，你的微型實驗不一定需要完全取代你正在進行的其他專案。安諾爾是一位企業家，Nest Labs 的作者，前 Google 員工，現在是新書《微型實驗》的作者。我是一名神經科學家，我對好奇心非常著迷。在 Google，我們被鼓勵在有限的範圍內保持好奇。在這段影片中，我們坐下來討論如何透過實驗來改善你的生活，而不是設定目標。直到我的新創公司失敗的那一刻，我才真正將生活視為一個巨大的實驗，那是我真正領悟到一些事情的時刻。你實際上正在將不確定性轉化為具有生成性和行動力的東西。再說一次，這些不是目標，它們是逐步改變你生活的方式，一次一個實驗。這樣做的方法是填寫一個非常簡單的模板，我稱之為「我」。蘿拉，非常感謝你今天加入我。謝謝你邀請我。我很高興。對於那些可能不認識你的人，他們應該知道關於你的一件事是什麼，這將為我們接下來要談論的內容提供一些背景。我對好奇心非常著迷。我是一名神經科學家，我在倫敦國王學院的 ADHD 研究實驗室研究神經科學，我每週都會寫一份電子報，內容都是關於系統性好奇心和專注生產力。我真的將我的生活分為兩個不同的章節。第一個章節非常線性，我非常專注於成功。我曾經在 Google 工作，我參與了幾家新創公司，傳統意義上的成功，找到一份好工作，獲得晉升，參與很酷的專案，賺錢，所有這些。直到我的新創公司失敗，我才回到大學學習神經科學，並開始了我人生的第二個章節，在這個章節中，我更具實驗性，並嘗試新事物。在你的生活中進行一個微型實驗是什麼樣子的？所以如果你想設計一個微型實驗，它都始於觀察。我知道對我們很多人來說，尤其是在生產力領域，我們喜歡做事，我們喜歡建造東西，我們喜歡探索發現的行動。所以我知道這可能會產生一些阻力，只是說，嘿，現在，我們實際上只是要觀察，你記下一些小筆記，不帶任何判斷，只是觀察。基於此，你開始形成一個假設。所以你觀察了事物的現狀，你開始問，可能會是什麼？可能會有所不同嗎？也許我會喜歡以不同的方式做這件事，也許我會喜歡做更多那樣的工作，只是憑直覺看看是否有什麼真正激發了你的好奇心。你可以開始設計你的第一個微型實驗。這樣做的方法是填寫一個非常簡單的模板，我稱之為 PCT，我將其定義為對好奇心的承諾。我將插入一個行動或插入一個持續時間。例如，我將在接下來的六週內每週寫一份電子報。我將在接下來的兩週內每天散步，並聽一個新的播客。我將在接下來的五週內每週一閱讀一篇研究論文，然後記下筆記，並在 Substack 上分享。你做到了，你沒有。你不要帶有判斷，你不要試圖分析它，你只是進行實驗，然後你等到完成，你經歷了所有這些重複，然後回頭看看那實際感覺如何。對於許多人，包括我自己，當我想到實際的實驗時，它似乎是學術界的領域，這可能會讓我覺得我正在進行的任何實驗都是錯的。所以我很好奇，運行一個，恕我直言，好的實驗在你的生活中，有什麼明顯的跡象？你正在進行一個好的實驗的第一個跡象可能不是你所期望的，但它取決於你是否對它感到興奮。你是否真的興奮地探索這個問題，在你的生活領域嘗試新事物？如果不是，那已經是一個很好的跡象，也許那不值得探索。所以你真正好奇的事情，你的好奇心水平是一個很好的因素。第二個是它是否可行。你真的能完成實驗嗎？如果你追求一些非常雄心勃勃的事情，但你從未完成數據收集，那麼這不是一個好的實驗。這就是為什麼如果你有疑問，總是最好嘗試一些更小、更短的事情。如果你想嘗試冥想，例如，也許先嘗試 10 天，不要馬上參加內觀靜修。先嘗試一些更容易管理的事情。電子報也是一樣，我的第一個電子報，我做得非常極端，我說 100 天，但從那以後，我改進了很多我的方法，我意識到堅持一些更小的事情要容易得多。所以不一定要追求 100 天寫 100 篇文章，只是說，那會是什麼樣子？也許接下來六週寫六份電子報。第三個是超出你舒適區的事情，你會從中學到新東西，而不是為了成功而優化的東西。如果你選擇一個實驗是因為它感覺很舒服，你覺得如果我這樣做，我知道我會得到這個結果，這很棒，這更像是一個常規專案，它不是一個真正的實驗。實驗需要從不確定性開始。你還沒有答案，你有一個假設，你可能對答案有一點點預感，你可能覺得我會喜歡這個，這可能會有所幫助，這可能會讓我更有效率，但我不是 100% 確定，這就是為什麼我正在進行實驗。所以這些將是我在設計一個好的實驗時會考慮的三個因素。我非常喜歡你創建的這個模型的一點是它的形式，恕我直言，它在標題中就是「微型實驗」。所以這個想法是，即使你有一份全職工作，或者你家庭生活很忙，或者類似的事情，你也可以進行這些實驗。我相信你實際上可以在做其他事情的同時進行實驗，你的微型實驗不一定需要完全取代你正在進行的其他專案。它們可能只是一種方式，也許可以發現你生活中另一個你想要探索、想要嘗試新事物的地方。事實上，我知道有些人確實喜歡在他們生活的一個領域保持相當穩定，而在另一個領域進行大量實驗。所以你可能會說，你知道嗎，實際上我有一份工作，我可以閉著眼睛做，我確切地知道我在做什麼，我在這個領域工作了很多年，我不會在那裡進行實驗，我對它的運作方式非常滿意，但我會對我的健康進行大量實驗。我想弄清楚什麼對我有效，什麼無效。我會嘗試不同的健身習慣，我會嘗試不同的飲食，我會嘗試我上床睡覺的時間，例如，我會記錄下來，看看這如何影響我的創造力和生產力。我一直覺得科學方法有趣的一點是，大多數人在進行實驗時，都試圖找到證明自己錯誤的方法，而這在我們思考個人生產力時根本不是這樣。很多時候我們嘗試一些事情，我們非常害怕失敗，這就像證明自己錯誤是最糟糕的事情。我很好奇，這種經過充分驗證的、用於發展我們所擁有的最佳知識的方法，當我們將其應用到自己的生活中時，為什麼會感覺如此困難？是的，這實際上是一個非常貼近我內心的問題，那就是我們如何重新定義我們與失敗的關係。我確實認為擁有實驗心態會很有幫助。我在書中有一整章，我談到了我對傳統目標定義的問題，如果你想確保你實現一個非常狹隘的成功定義，這些目標很棒。所以這是一種更具實驗性的方法，而不是我們很多人在生產力系統中使用的那種線性、智能目標式的方法。科學家唯一的目標是學習新東西。如果到實驗結束時，你收集了新數據，並且你學到了新東西，無論是關於世界、關於你的工作還是關於你自己，那麼這就是成功。我知道對很多人來說，這感覺不那麼令人滿意，因為沒有那麼多的終極目標感、目的地感和里程碑感，但這就是你如何確保你不斷成長，即使你不知道自己要去哪裡，也因為如此，你可能會走向一個與你最初想像的截然不同的方向，這完全沒問題。我很想多聽一些關於微型實驗的內容，這些實驗不是關於完成更多工作，或者獲得更多追隨者，或者更多金錢，或者更多腹肌，或者類似的東西，而更多的是情感上和高度個人化的應用。是的，當然，你不必只為你的工作或生產力進行實驗，它們實際上對我稱之為內在好奇心，這種自我好奇心非常有幫助，你將注意力轉向內在，你試圖弄清楚這裡發生了什麼，什麼是有趣的，什麼可以改變，我想嘗試什麼。你可以嘗試冥想、寫日記、獨自靜坐並觀察自己的想法。實驗的另一個好處是，你不會像習慣一樣，承諾一輩子都這樣做。例如，你對你的伴侶說，從現在開始，我們餘生都必須在每個星期五進行約會之夜。你可以說，我們就這樣做一兩個月，看看我們是否喜歡，然後我們可以一起調整。你的工作也是一樣，你可以說，我實際上會嘗試這個系統幾週，我會看看它是否對我有效。這就是實驗和習慣的區別，習慣是你已經知道這對你來說是好事，你已經相信如果你永遠堅持這個習慣，這對你來說會是好事。而實驗是你覺得這可能對你來說是好事，但你不會因為它對其他人有效就認為它對你也會有效。所以你會測試它，你會收集自己的數據，並根據這些數據決定是否要繼續、調整或完全放棄它。你現在生活中正在進行哪些微型實驗？如果你有時間進行任何微型實驗的話。哦，這很有趣，因為我目前正在進行的實驗是基於我幾乎沒有時間的事實。所以我正在進行一個實驗，我承諾在接下來的 20 天裡，每天散步 20 分鐘，無論發生什麼。我正處於宣傳階段，我錄製了相當多的播客，我正在開會，我有很多文案要寫，我可能會整天坐在電腦前，然後累到只想躺在床上，也許看點 Netflix，然後周而復始。那時我決定，好吧，我需要找到一個能讓我感覺更好的實驗。我不太確定，再說一次，我沒有答案，它是否有效？我不知道。但在我提出的所有方案中，這感覺是目前最容易實施的實驗，考慮到我幾乎為零的心理空間，以及我幾乎為零的精力。這就是為什麼我以這種方式設計這個實驗，只有 20 分鐘，非常非常短，而且只持續接下來的 20 天，這幾乎會讓我一直忙到新書發布會。我們會看看它是否有效，我可能會繼續下去。實際上，人們可能第一次聽到這個，他們可能不知道從何開始構建一個微型實驗。鑑於你正處於「我沒有時間做任何事情」的狀態，有沒有幾個問題或提示可以幫助人們思考如何創建一個微型實驗？實際上，有一件非常有趣的事情，你可以很快做到，那就是打開你的日曆，看看你上週是如何度過的，就這樣。然後打開筆記本或記下一些筆記，但看看會議，問問自己，有些會議是否給你帶來了能量，有些是否耗盡了你的能量，什麼感覺良好。查看你的日曆是一種激發這些想法的方式。問問自己，有什麼我可以改變的嗎？就這樣。有什麼我可以改變的嗎？它可以非常非常小，然後下週嘗試一下，就說五天，我要以不同的方式做這件事，就這樣，你就有你的第一個微型實驗了。要開始設計你自己的微型實驗，請購買你自己的《微型實驗》一書。我們也會在下方提供所有這些資訊，以及你可以找到安諾爾令人難以置信的作品的不同地方。安諾爾，非常感謝你寫這本書並花時間與我們在一起。人們可以在哪裡了解更多關於你的資訊？非常感謝你邀請我。你可以到 nls.com，在那裡你可以訂閱我每週四發送的電子報。如果你想購買這本書，你可以在任何販售書籍的地方搜尋《微型實驗》。

**ai**: 好的，這是該筆記的結構化內容整理：

## 微型實驗：改變你人生的系統 (Tiny Experiments: A System to Change Your Life)

### 一、 講者介紹與核心理念
- **講者**：Anne-Laure Le Cunff，企業家，Nest Labs 作者，前 Google 員工，神經科學家。
- **新書**：《微型實驗》(Tiny Experiments)。
- **核心理念**：透過運行「微型實驗」來改善生活，而非僅設定目標。將不確定性轉化為具生成性和行動力的事物，逐步迭代地改變生活。

### 二、 講者的個人經歷
- **第一章 (線性成功)**：
    - 專注於傳統成功定義：好工作 (Google)、晉升、酷專案、賺錢。
    - 結果：儘管外部成功，但內心感到空虛、無聊和筋疲力盡。
    - 創業失敗後，首次對下一步感到迷茫。
- **第二章 (實驗性生活)**：
    - 回歸好奇心：回到大學學習神經科學。
    - 透過每週電子報公開學習，將神經科學見解轉化為實用工具。
    - 意識到生活是一個巨大的實驗，開始過上更具實驗性的生活。

### 三、 如何設計微型實驗
1.  **觀察 (Observation)**：從觀察你目前的生活狀況開始，不帶判斷地記下筆記。
2.  **形成假設 (Formulate a Hypothesis)**：根據觀察結果，思考「可能會是什麼？」「可能會有所不同嗎？」憑直覺判斷什麼激發了你的好奇心。
3.  **設計實驗 (Design the Experiment)**：
    - 使用簡單的模板，講者稱之為 **PCT (Commitment to Curiosity)**，即「對好奇心的承諾」。
    - **格式**：「我將執行 [一個行動] 持續 [一段時間]。」
    - **範例**：
        - 「我將在接下來的六週內每週寫一份電子報。」
        - 「我將在接下來的兩週內每天散步，並聽一個新的播客。」
        - 「我將在接下來的五週內每週一閱讀一篇研究論文，然後記下筆記，並在 Substack 上分享。」
4.  **執行與數據收集 (Conduct and Collect Data)**：
    - 執行實驗，不帶判斷，不急於分析。
    - 等待實驗完成，回顧實際感受。

### 四、 良好實驗的特徵
1.  **激發好奇心 (Excitement/Curiosity)**：你是否對探索這個問題感到興奮？如果沒有，可能不值得探索。
2.  **可行性 (Doability)**：實驗是否能夠實際完成？
    - 選擇更小、更短的實驗，避免過於雄心勃勃而無法完成數據收集。
    - 範例：冥想先試 10 天，而非直接參加內觀靜修；電子報先試 6 週，而非 100 天。
3.  **跳出舒適區 (Out of Comfort Zone)**：
    - 實驗應能讓你學習新事物，而非僅為成功而優化。
    - 實驗應從不確定性開始，你沒有預設答案，只有假設。

### 五、 微型實驗的優勢
- **可與其他事務並行**：即使有全職工作或忙碌的家庭生活，也能在旁進行。
- **靈活探索**：可以在生活的一個領域進行實驗，同時在其他領域保持穩定。
- **重新定義失敗**：科學家唯一的目標是學習新事物。只要收集到新數據並有所學習，就是成功。
- **持續成長**：即使不知道最終目的地，也能透過每個實驗週期不斷成長。
- **個人化應用**：不僅限於工作或生產力，也適用於內在好奇心，例如冥想、寫日記、觀察自己的想法。
- **非終身承諾**：與習慣不同，實驗有明確的持續時間，允許你測試後再決定是否繼續、調整或放棄。

### 六、 講者目前的微型實驗範例
- **情境**：正處於新書宣傳期，時間和精力都極度有限。
- **實驗**：承諾在接下來的 20 天裡，每天散步 20 分鐘。
- **目的**：在極度忙碌中找到讓自己感覺更好的方法，即使不確定效果。

### 七、 如何開始設計自己的微型實驗
1.  **回顧日曆**：打開日曆，看看你上週是如何度過的。
2.  **記錄感受**：記下哪些會議或活動讓你充滿能量，哪些讓你感到疲憊。
3.  **提出問題**：問自己：「有什麼我可以改變的嗎？」
4.  **從小處著手**：選擇一個非常小的改變，並在下週嘗試 5 天。
5.  **開始你的第一個微型實驗**。

### 八、 更多資訊
